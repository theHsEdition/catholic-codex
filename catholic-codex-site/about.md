## What is the Catholic Codex?

>Our goal is to help everyone understand the Catholic Church and the teachings that make up the Catholic faith. From there, you can hate what we teach, and you can hate usâ€”but a great start is learning more about what you're hating.

### Our Goals
- Church teaching on modern issues
- Easy to understand and read
- All information should be based off the Catechism and Magisterium Teaching
- Get content verified and approved by reputable sources

## Can I get involved?

Yes, yes you can. We're glad you asked. You can ask questions, submit ideas or simply sharing this site with your family, friends and enemies.
