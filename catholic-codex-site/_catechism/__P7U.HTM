<p class=MsoNormal>The duties
of children</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2214
The divine fatherhood is the source of human fatherhood;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AO href=#$2AO>16</a></sup></font> this is the
foundation of the honor owed to parents. the respect of children, whether
minors or adults, for their father and mother<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AP href=#$2AP>17</a></sup></font> is nourished by the
natural affection born of the bond uniting them. It is required by God's
commandment.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AQ href=#$2AQ>18</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2215
Respect for parents (filial piety) derives from gratitude toward those who, by
the gift of life, their love and their work, have brought their children into
the world and enabled them to grow in stature, wisdom, and grace. &quot;With
all your heart honor your father, and do not forget the birth pangs of your
mother. Remember that through your parents you were born; what can you give
back to them that equals their gift to you?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AR href=#$2AR>19</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2216
Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. &quot;My son, keep your
father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching.... When you walk,
they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you
awake, they will talk with you.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AS href=#$2AS>20</a></sup></font> &quot;A wise son hears his
father's instruction, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AT href=#$2AT>21</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2217
As
long as a child lives at home with his parents, the child should obey his
parents in all that they ask of him when it is for his good or that of the
family. &quot;Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the
Lord.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AU href=#$2AU>22</a></sup></font> Children should also obey the reasonable directions of
their teachers and all to whom their parents have entrusted them. But if a
child is convinced in conscience that it would be morally wrong to obey a
particular order, he must not do so. <br>
As they grow up, children should continue to respect their parents. They should
anticipate their wishes, willingly seek their advice, and accept their just
admonitions. Obedience toward parents ceases with the emancipation of the
children; not so respect, which is always owed to them. This respect has its
roots in the fear of God, one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2218
The fourth commandment reminds grown children of their responsibilities toward
their parents. As much as they can, they must give them material and moral
support in old age and in times of illness, loneliness, or distress. Jesus
recalls this duty of gratitude.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AV href=#$2AV>23</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>For the Lord honored the
father above the children, and he confirmed the right of the mother over her
sons. Whoever honors his father atones for sins, and whoever glorifies his
mother is like one who lays up treasure. Whoever honors his father will be
gladdened by his own children, and when he prays he will be heard. Whoever
glorifies his father will have long life, and whoever obeys the Lord will
refresh his mother.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AW href=#$2AW>24</a></sup></font> <br>
O son, help your father in his old age, and do not grieve him as long as he
lives; even if he is lacking in understanding, show forbearance; in all your
strength do not despise him.... Whoever forsakes his father is like a
blasphemer, and whoever angers his mother is cursed by the Lord.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AX href=#$2AX>25</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2219
Filial respect promotes harmony in all of family life; it also concerns
relationships between brothers and sisters. Respect toward parents fills the
home with light and warmth. &quot;Grandchildren are the crown of the
aged.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AY href=#$2AY>26</a></sup></font> &quot;With all humility and meekness, with patience,
[support] one another in charity.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AZ href=#$2AZ>27</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2220
For Christians a special gratitude is due to those from whom they have received
the gift of faith, the grace of Baptism, and life in the Church. These may
include parents, grandparents, other members of the family, pastors,
catechists, and other teachers or friends. &quot;I am reminded of your sincere
faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice
and now, I am sure, dwells in you.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2B0 href=#$2B0>28</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The duties
of parents</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2221
The fecundity of conjugal love cannot be reduced solely to the procreation of
children, but must extend to their moral education and their spiritual
formation. &quot;The role of parents in education is of such importance that it
is almost impossible to provide an adequate substitute.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2B1 href=#$2B1>29</a></sup></font> The
right and the duty of parents to educate their children are primordial and
inalienable.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2B2 href=#$2B2>30</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2222
Parents must regard their children as children of God and respect them as human
persons. Showing themselves obedient to the will of the Father in heaven, they
educate their children to fulfill God's law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2223
Parents have the first responsibility for the education of their children. They
bear witness to this responsibility first by creating a home where tenderness,
forgiveness, respect, fidelity, and disinterested service are the rule. the
home is well suited for education in the virtues. This requires an
apprenticeship in self-denial, sound judgment, and self-mastery - the
preconditions of all true freedom. Parents should teach their children to
subordinate the &quot;material and instinctual dimensions to interior and
spiritual ones.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2B3 href=#$2B3>31</a></sup></font> Parents have a grave responsibility to give
good example to their children. By knowing how to acknowledge their own
failings to their children, parents will be better able to guide and correct
them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>He who loves his son will not
spare the rod.... He who disciplines his son will profit by him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2B4 href=#$2B4>32</a></sup></font> <br>
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the
discipline and instruction of the Lord.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2B5 href=#$2B5>33</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2224
The home is the natural environment for initiating a human being into
solidarity and communal responsibilities. Parents should teach children to
avoid the compromising and degrading influences which threaten human societies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2225
Through the grace of the sacrament of marriage, parents receive the
responsibility and privilege of evangelizing their children. Parents should
initiate their children at an early age into the mysteries of the faith of
which they are the &quot;first heralds&quot; for their children. They should
associate them from their tenderest years with the life of the Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2B6 href=#$2B6>34</a></sup></font>
A wholesome family life can foster interior dispositions that are a genuine
preparation for a living faith and remain a support for it throughout one's
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2226
Education in the faith by the parents should begin in the child's earliest
years. This already happens when family members help one another to grow in
faith by the witness of a Christian life in keeping with the Gospel. Family
catechesis precedes, accompanies, and enriches other forms of instruction in
the faith. Parents have the mission of teaching their children to pray and to
discover their vocation as children of God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2B7 href=#$2B7>35</a></sup></font> The parish is the
Eucharistic community and the heart of the liturgical life of Christian
families; it is a privileged place for the catechesis of children and parents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2227
Children in turn contribute to the growth in holiness of their
parents.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2B8 href=#$2B8>36</a></sup></font> Each and everyone should be generous and tireless in
forgiving one another for offenses, quarrels, injustices, and neglect. Mutual
affection suggests this. the charity of Christ demands it.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2B9 href=#$2B9>37</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2228
Parents' respect and affection are expressed by the care and attention they
devote to bringing up their young children and providing for their physical and
spiritual needs. As the children grow up, the same respect and devotion lead
parents to educate them in the right use of their reason and freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2229
As those first responsible for the education of their children, parents have
the right to choose a school for them which corresponds to their own
convictions. This right is fundamental. As far as possible parents have the
duty of choosing schools that will best help them in their task as Christian
educators.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2BA href=#$2BA>38</a></sup></font> Public authorities have the duty of guaranteeing this
parental right and of ensuring the concrete conditions for its exercise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2230
When they become adults, children have the right and duty to choose their
profession and state of life. They should assume their new responsibilities
within a trusting relationship with their parents, willingly asking and
receiving their advice and counsel. Parents should be careful not to exert
pressure on their children either in the choice of a profession or in that of a
spouse. This necessary restraint does not prevent them - quite the contrary
from giving their children judicious advice, particularly when they are
planning to start a family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2231
Some forgo marriage in order to care for their parents or brothers and sisters,
to give themselves more completely to a profession, or to serve other honorable
ends. They can contribute greatly to the good of the human family.</p>
