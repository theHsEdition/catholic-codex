<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>III. How is the Sacrament of Baptism
Celebrated?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christian
Initiation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1229
From the time of the apostles, becoming a Christian has been accomplished by a
journey and initiation in several stages. This journey can be covered rapidly
or slowly, but certain essential elements will always have to be present:
proclamation of the Word, acceptance of the Gospel entailing conversion,
profession of faith, Baptism itself, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and
admission to Eucharistic communion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1230
This
initiation has varied greatly through the centuries according to circumstances.
In the first centuries of the Church, Christian initiation saw considerable
development. A long period of catechumenate included a series of preparatory
rites, which were liturgical landmarks along the path of catechumenal
preparation and culminated in the celebration of the sacraments of Christian
initiation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1231
Where
infant Baptism has become the form in which this sacrament is usually
celebrated, it has become a single act encapsulating the preparatory stages of
Christian initiation in a very abridged way. By its very nature infant Baptism
requires a post-baptismal catechumenate. Not only is there a need for
instruction after Baptism, but also for the necessary flowering of baptismal
grace in personal growth. the catechism has its proper place here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1232
The
second Vatican Council restored for the Latin Church &quot;the catechumenate
for adults, comprising several distinct steps.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1I5 href=#$1I5>34</a></sup></font> The rites for
these stages are to be found in the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults
(RCIA).<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1I6 href=#$1I6>35</a></sup></font> The Council also gives permission that: &quot;In mission
countries, in addition to what is furnished by the Christian tradition, those
elements of initiation rites may be admitted which are already in use among
some peoples insofar as they can be adapted to the Christian
ritual.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1I7 href=#$1I7>36</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1233
Today
in all the rites, Latin and Eastern, the Christian initiation of adults begins
with their entry into the catechumenate and reaches its culmination in a single
celebration of the three sacraments of initiation: Baptism, Confirmation, and
the Eucharist.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1I8 href=#$1I8>37</a></sup></font> In the Eastern rites the Christian initiation of
infants also begins with Baptism followed immediately by Confirmation and the
Eucharist, while in the Roman rite it is followed by years of catechesis before
being completed later by Confirmation and the Eucharist, the summit of their
Christian initiation.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1I9 href=#$1I9>38</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
mystagogy of the celebration</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1234
The meaning and grace of the sacrament of Baptism are clearly seen in the rites
of its celebration. By following the gestures and words of this celebration
with attentive participation, the faithful are initiated into the riches this
sacrament signifies and actually brings about in each newly baptized person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1235
The sign of the cross, on the threshold of the celebration, marks with the
imprint of Christ the one who is going to belong to him and signifies the grace
of the redemption Christ won for us by his cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1236
The proclamation of the Word of God enlightens the candidates and the assembly
with the revealed truth and elicits the response of faith, which is inseparable
from Baptism. Indeed Baptism is &quot;the sacrament of faith&quot; in a
particular way, since it is the sacramental entry into the life of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1237
Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil,
one or more exorcisms are pronounced over the candidate. the celebrant then
anoints him with the oil of catechumens, or lays his hands on him, and he
explicitly renounces Satan. Thus prepared, he is able to confess the faith of
the Church, to which he will be &quot;entrusted&quot; by Baptism.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IA href=#$1IA>39</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1238
The baptismal water is consecrated by a prayer of epiclesis (either at this moment
or at the Easter Vigil). the Church asks God that through his Son the power of
the Holy Spirit may be sent upon the water, so that those who will be baptized
in it may be &quot;born of water and the Spirit.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IB href=#$1IB>40</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1239
The essential rite of the sacrament follows: Baptism properly speaking. It
signifies and actually brings about death to sin and entry into the life of the
Most Holy Trinity through configuration to the Paschal mystery of Christ.
Baptism is performed in the most expressive way by triple immersion in the
baptismal water. However, from ancient times it has also been able to be
conferred by pouring the water three times over the candidate's head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1240
In the
Latin Church this triple infusion is accompanied by the minister's words:
&quot;N., I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Spirit.&quot; In the Eastern liturgies the catechumen turns toward the
East and the priest says: &quot;The servant of God, N., is baptized in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&quot; At the invocation
of each person of the Most Holy Trinity, the priest immerses the candidate in
the water and raises him up again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1241
The anointing with sacred chrism, perfumed oil consecrated by the bishop,
signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit to the newly baptized, who has become a
Christian, that is, one &quot;anointed&quot; by the Holy Spirit, incorporated
into Christ who is anointed priest, prophet, and king.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IC href=#$1IC>41</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1242
In the liturgy of the Eastern Churches, the post-baptismal anointing is the
sacrament of Chrismation (Confirmation). In the Roman liturgy the
post-baptismal anointing announces a second anointing with sacred chrism to be
conferred later by the bishop Confirmation, which will as it were
&quot;confirm&quot; and complete the baptismal anointing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1243
The white garment symbolizes that the person baptized has &quot;put on
Christ,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1ID href=#$1ID>42</a></sup></font> has risen with Christ. the candle, lit from the Easter
candle, signifies that Christ has enlightened the neophyte. In him the baptized
are &quot;the light of the world.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IE href=#$1IE>43</a></sup></font> <br>
The newly baptized is now, in the only Son, a child of God entitled to say the
prayer of the children of God: &quot;Our Father.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1244
First Holy Communion. Having become a child of God clothed with the wedding
garment, the neophyte is admitted &quot;to the marriage supper of the
Lamb&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IF href=#$1IF>44</a></sup></font> and receives the food of the new life, the body and blood
of Christ. the Eastern Churches maintain a lively awareness of the unity of
Christian initiation by giving Holy Communion to all the newly baptized and
confirmed, even little children, recalling the Lord's words: &quot;Let the
children come to me, do not hinder them.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IG href=#$1IG>45</a></sup></font> The Latin Church,
which reserves admission to Holy Communion to those who have attained the age
of reason, expresses the orientation of Baptism to the Eucharist by having the
newly baptized child brought to the altar for the praying of the Our Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1245
The solemn blessing concludes the celebration of Baptism. At the Baptism of
newborns the blessing of the mother occupies a special place.</p>
