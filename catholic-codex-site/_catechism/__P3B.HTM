<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>IN BRIEF</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1187 The liturgy is the work
of the whole Christ, head and body. Our high priest celebrates it unceasingly
in the heavenly liturgy, with the holy Mother of God, the apostles, all the
saints, and the multitude of those who have already entered the kingdom.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1188 In a liturgical
celebration, the whole assembly is leitourgos, each member according to his own
function. the baptismal priesthood is that of the whole Body of Christ. But
some of the faithful are ordained through the sacrament of Holy Orders to
represent Christ as head of the Body.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1189 The liturgical
celebration involves signs and symbols relating to creation (candles, water,
fire), human life (washing, anointing, breaking bread) and the history of
salvation (the rites of the Passover). Integrated into the world of faith and
taken up by the power of the Holy Spirit, these cosmic elements, human rituals,
and gestures of remembrance of God become bearers of the saving and sanctifying
action of Christ.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1190 The Liturgy of the Word
is an integral part of the celebration. the meaning of the celebration is
expressed by the Word of God which is proclaimed and by the response of faith
to it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1191 Song and music are
closely connected with the liturgical action. the criteria for their proper use
are the beauty expressive of prayer, the unanimous participation of the
assembly, and the sacred character of the celebration.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1192 Sacred images in our
churches and homes are intended to awaken and nourish our faith in the mystery
of Christ. Through the icon of Christ and his works of salvation, it is he whom
we adore. Through sacred images of the holy Mother of God, of the angels and of
the saints, we venerate the persons represented.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1193 Sunday, the &quot;Lord's
Day,&quot; is the principal day for the celebration of the Eucharist because it
is the day of the Resurrection. It is the pre-eminent day of the liturgical
assembly, the day of the Christian family, and the day of joy and rest from
work. Sunday is &quot;the foundation and kernel of the whole liturgical
year&quot; (SC 106).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1194 The Church, &quot;in the
course of the year, . . . unfolds the whole mystery of Christ from his
Incarnation and Nativity through his Ascension, to Pentecost and the
expectation of the blessed hope of the coming of the Lord&quot; (SC 102 # 2).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1195 By keeping the memorials
of the saints - first of all the holy Mother of God, then the apostles, the
martyrs, and other saints - on fixed days of the liturgical year, the Church on
earth shows that she is united with the liturgy of heaven. She gives glory to
Christ for having accomplished his salvation in his glorified members; their
example encourages her on her way to the Father.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1196 The faithful who
celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours are united to Christ our high priest, by the
prayer of the Psalms, meditation on the Word of God, and canticles and
blessings, in order to be joined with his unceasing and universal prayer that
gives glory to the Father and implores the gift of the Holy Spirit on the whole
world.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1197
Christ is the true temple of God, &quot;the place where his glory dwells&quot;;
by the grace of God, Christians also become the temples of the Holy Spirit,
living stones out of which the Church is built.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1198 In its earthly state the
Church needs places where the community can gather together. Our visible churches,
holy places, are images of the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, toward which
we are making our way on pilgrimage.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1199 It is in these churches
that the Church celebrates public worship to the glory of the Holy Trinity,
hears the word of God and sings his praise, lifts up her prayer, and offers the
sacrifice of Christ sacramentally present in the midst of the assembly. These
churches are also places of recollection and personal prayer.</i></p>
