<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>II. Abba -
&quot;Father!&quot;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2779
Before we make our own this first exclamation of the Lord's Prayer, we must
humbly cleanse our hearts of certain false images drawn &quot;from this
world.&quot; Humility makes us recognize that &quot;no one knows the Son except
the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the
Son chooses to reveal him,&quot; that is, &quot;to little
children.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RF href=#$2RF>30</a></sup></font> The purification of our hearts has to do with
paternal or maternal images, stemming from our personal and cultural history,
and influencing our relationship with God. God our Father transcends the
categories of the created world. To impose our own ideas in this area
&quot;upon him&quot; would be to fabricate idols to adore or pull down. To pray
to the Father is to enter into his mystery as he is and as the Son has revealed
him to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The expression God the Father
had never been revealed to anyone. When Moses himself asked God who he was, he
heard another name. the Father's name has been revealed to us in the Son, for
the name &quot;Son&quot; implies the new name &quot;Father.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RG href=#$2RG>31</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2780
We can invoke God as &quot;Father&quot; because he is revealed to us by his Son
become man and because his Spirit makes him known to us. the personal relation
of the Son to the Father is something that man cannot conceive of nor the
angelic powers even dimly see: and yet, the Spirit of the Son grants a
participation in that very relation to us who believe that Jesus is the Christ
and that we are born of God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RH href=#$2RH>32</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2781
When we pray to the Father, we are in communion with him and with his Son,
Jesus Christ.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RI href=#$2RI>33</a></sup></font> Then we know and recognize him with an ever new sense
of wonder. the first phrase of the Our Father is a blessing of adoration before
it is a supplication. For it is the glory of God that we should recognize him
as &quot;Father,&quot; the true God. We give him thanks for having revealed his
name to us, for the gift of believing in it, and for the indwelling of his
Presence in us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2782
We can adore the Father because he has caused us to be reborn to his life by
adopting us as his children in his only Son: by Baptism, he incorporates us
into the Body of his Christ; through the anointing of his Spirit who flows from
the head to the members, he makes us other &quot;Christs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>God, indeed, who has
predestined us to adoption as his sons, has conformed us to the glorious Body
of Christ. So then you who have become sharers in Christ are appropriately
called &quot;Christs.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RJ href=#$2RJ>34</a></sup></font> <br>
The new man, reborn and restored to his God by grace, says first of all,
&quot;Father!&quot; because he has now begun to be a son.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RK href=#$2RK>35</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2783
Thus the Lord's Prayer reveals us to ourselves at the same time that it reveals
the Father to us.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RL href=#$2RL>36</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>O man, you did not dare to
raise your face to heaven, you lowered your eyes to the earth, and suddenly you
have received the grace of Christ all your sins have been forgiven. From being
a wicked servant you have become a good son.... Then raise your eyes to the
Father who has begotten you through Baptism, to the Father who has redeemed you
through his Son, and say: &quot;Our Father.... &quot; But do not claim any
privilege. He is the Father in a special way only of Christ, but he is the
common Father of us all, because while he has begotten only Christ, he has created
us. Then also say by his grace, &quot;Our Father,&quot; so that you may merit
being his son.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RM href=#$2RM>37</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2784
The free gift of adoption requires on our part continual conversion and new
life. Praying to our Father should develop in us two fundamental dispositions: <br>
First, the desire to become like him: though created in his image, we are
restored to his likeness by grace; and we must respond to this grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>We must remember . . . and
know that when we call God &quot;our Father&quot; we ought to behave as sons of
God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RN href=#$2RN>38</a></sup></font> <br>
You cannot call the God of all kindness your Father if you preserve a cruel and
inhuman heart; for in this case you no longer have in you the marks of the
heavenly Father's kindness.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RO href=#$2RO>39</a></sup></font> <br>
We must contemplate the beauty of the Father without ceasing and adorn our own
souls accordingly.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RP href=#$2RP>40</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2785
Second, a humble and trusting heart that enables us &quot;to turn and become
like children&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RQ href=#$2RQ>41</a></sup></font> for it is to &quot;little children&quot; that
the Father is revealed.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RR href=#$2RR>42</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>[The prayer is accomplished]
by the contemplation of God alone, and by the warmth of love, through which the
soul, molded and directed to love him, speaks very familiarly to God as to its
own Father with special devotion.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RS href=#$2RS>43</a></sup></font> <br>
Our Father: at this name love is aroused in us . . . and the confidence of
obtaining what we are about to ask.... What would he not give to his children
who ask, since he has already granted them the gift of being his
children?<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2RT href=#$2RT>44</a></sup></font></p>
