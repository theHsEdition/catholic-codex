<p class=MsoNormal>2475
Christ's disciples have &quot;put on the new man, created after the likeness of
God in true righteousness and holiness.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2HS href=#$2HS>273</a></sup></font> By &quot;putting away
falsehood,&quot; they are to &quot;put away all malice and all guile and
insincerity and envy and all slander.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2HT href=#$2HT>274</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2476
False witness and perjury. When it is made publicly, a statement contrary to
the truth takes on a particular gravity. In court it becomes false
witness.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2HU href=#$2HU>275</a></sup></font> When it is under oath, it is perjury. Acts such as these
contribute to condemnation of the innocent, exoneration of the guilty, or the
increased punishment of the accused.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2HV href=#$2HV>276</a></sup></font> They gravely compromise the
exercise of justice and the fairness of judicial decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2477
Respect for the reputation of persons forbids every attitude and word likely to
cause them unjust injury.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2HW href=#$2HW>277</a></sup></font> He becomes guilty: <br>
- of rash judgment who, even tacitly, assumes as true, without sufficient
foundation, the moral fault of a neighbor; <br>
- of detraction who, without objectively valid reason, discloses another's
faults and failings to persons who did not know them;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2HX href=#$2HX>278</a></sup></font> <br>
- of calumny who, by remarks contrary to the truth, harms the reputation of
others and gives occasion for false judgments concerning them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2478
To avoid rash judgment, everyone should be careful to interpret insofar as
possible his neighbor's thoughts, words, and deeds in a favorable way:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Every good Christian ought to
be more ready to give a favorable interpretation to another's statement than to
condemn it. But if he cannot do so, let him ask how the other understands it.
and if the latter understands it badly, let the former correct him with love.
If that does not suffice, let the Christian try all suitable ways to bring the
other to a correct interpretation so that he may be saved.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2HY href=#$2HY>279</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2479
Detraction and calumny destroy the reputation and honor of one's neighbor.
Honor is the social witness given to human dignity, and everyone enjoys a
natural right to the honor of his name and reputation and to respect. Thus,
detraction and calumny offend against the virtues of justice and charity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2480
Every word or attitude is forbidden which by flattery, adulation, or
complaisance encourages and confirms another in malicious acts and perverse
conduct. Adulation is a grave fault if it makes one an accomplice in another's
vices or grave sins. Neither the desire to be of service nor friendship
justifies duplicitous speech. Adulation is a venial sin when it only seeks to be
agreeable, to avoid evil, to meet a need, or to obtain legitimate advantages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2481
Boasting or bragging is an offense against truth. So is irony aimed at
disparaging someone by maliciously caricaturing some aspect of his behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2482
&quot;A lie consists in speaking a falsehood with the intention of
deceiving.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2HZ href=#$2HZ>280</a></sup></font> The Lord denounces lying as the work of the devil:
&quot;You are of your father the devil, . . . there is no truth in him. When he
lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of
lies.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2I0 href=#$2I0>281</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2483
Lying is the most direct offense against the truth. To lie is to speak or act
against the truth in order to lead into error someone who has the right to know
the truth. By injuring man's relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie
offends against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2484
The gravity of a lie is measured against the nature of the truth it deforms,
the circumstances, the intentions of the one who lies, and the harm suffered by
its victims. If a lie in itself only constitutes a venial sin, it becomes
mortal when it does grave injury to the virtues of justice and charity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2485
By its very nature, lying is to be condemned. It is a profanation of speech,
whereas the purpose of speech is to communicate known truth to others. the
deliberate intention of leading a neighbor into error by saying things contrary
to the truth constitutes a failure in justice and charity. the culpability is
greater when the intention of deceiving entails the risk of deadly consequences
for those who are led astray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2486
Since it violates the virtue of truthfulness, a lie does real violence to
another. It affects his ability to know, which is a condition of every judgment
and decision. It contains the seed of discord and all consequent evils. Lying
is destructive of society; it undermines trust among men and tears apart the
fabric of social relationships.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2487
Every offense committed against justice and truth entails the duty of
reparation, even if its author has been forgiven. When it is impossible
publicly to make reparation for a wrong, it must be made secretly. If someone
who has suffered harm cannot be directly compensated, he must be given moral
satisfaction in the name of charity. This duty of reparation also concerns
offenses against another's reputation. This reparation, moral and sometimes
material, must be evaluated in terms of the extent of the damage inflicted. It
obliges in conscience.</p>
