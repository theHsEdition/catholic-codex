<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>I. The Natural Moral Law</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1954
Man participates in the wisdom and goodness of the Creator who gives him
mastery over his acts and the ability to govern himself with a view to the true
and the good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The natural
law expresses the original moral sense which enables man to discern by reason
the good and the evil, the truth and the lie:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The natural law is written and
engraved in the soul of each and every man, because it is human reason
ordaining him to do good and forbidding him to sin . . . But this command of
human reason would not have the force of law if it were not the voice and
interpreter of a higher reason to which our spirit and our freedom must be
submitted.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-23F href=#$23F>5</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1955
The &quot;divine and natural&quot; law<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-23G href=#$23G>6</a></sup></font> shows man the way to follow so
as to practice the good and attain his end. the natural law states the first
and essential precepts which govern the moral life. It hinges upon the desire
for God and submission to him, who is the source and judge of all that is good,
as well as upon the sense that the other is one's equal. Its principal precepts
are expressed in the Decalogue. This law is called &quot;natural,&quot; not in
reference to the nature of irrational beings, but because reason which decrees
it properly belongs to human nature:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Where then are these rules
written, if not in the book of that light we call the truth? In it is written
every just law; from it the law passes into the heart of the man who does
justice, not that it migrates into it, but that it places its imprint on it,
like a seal on a ring that passes onto wax, without leaving the ring.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-23H href=#$23H>7</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The natural law is nothing
other than the light of understanding placed in us by God; through it we know
what we must do and what we must avoid. God has given this light or law at the
creation.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-23I href=#$23I>8</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1956
The natural law, present in the heart of each man and established by reason, is
universal in its precepts and its authority extends to all men. It expresses
the dignity of the person and determines the basis for his fundamental rights
and duties:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>For there is a true law: right
reason. It is in conformity with nature, is diffused among all men, and is
immutable and eternal; its orders summon to duty; its prohibitions turn away from
offense .... To replace it with a contrary law is a sacrilege; failure to apply
even one of its provisions is forbidden; no one can abrogate it
entirely.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-23J href=#$23J>9</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1957
Application of the natural law varies greatly; it can demand reflection that
takes account of various conditions of life according to places, times, and
circumstances. Nevertheless, in the diversity of cultures, the natural law
remains as a rule that binds men among themselves and imposes on them, beyond
the inevitable differences, common principles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1958
The natural law is immutable and permanent throughout the variations of
history;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-23K href=#$23K>10</a></sup></font> it subsists under the flux of ideas and customs and supports
their progress. the rules that express it remain substantially valid. Even when
it is rejected in its very principles, it cannot be destroyed or removed from
the heart of man. It always rises again in the life of individuals and
societies:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Theft is surely punished by
your law, O Lord, and by the law that is written in the human heart, the law
that iniquity itself does not efface.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-23L href=#$23L>11</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1959
The natural law, the Creator's very good work, provides the solid foundation on
which man can build the structure of moral rules to guide his choices. It also
provides the indispensable moral foundation for building the human community.
Finally, it provides the necessary basis for the civil law with which it is
connected, whether by a reflection that draws conclusions from its principles,
or by additions of a positive and juridical nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1960
The precepts of natural law are not perceived by everyone clearly and
immediately. In the present situation sinful man needs grace and revelation so
moral and religious truths may be known &quot;by everyone with facility, with
firm certainty and with no admixture of error.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-23M href=#$23M>12</a></sup></font> The natural law
provides revealed law and grace with a foundation prepared by God and in
accordance with the work of the Spirit.</p>
