<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>V. The </b><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

of Conjugal Love</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1643
&quot;Conjugal love involves a totality, in which all the elements of the
person enter - appeal of the body and instinct, power of feeling and
affectivity, aspiration of the spirit and of will. It aims at a deeply personal
unity, a unity that, beyond union in one flesh, leads to forming one heart and
soul; it demands indissolubility and faithfulness in definitive mutual giving;
and it is open to fertility. In a word it is a question of the normal
characteristics of all natural conjugal love, but with a new significance which
not only purifies and strengthens them, but raises them to the extent of making
them the expression of specifically Christian values.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1W3 href=#$1W3>150</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The unity
and indissolubility of marriage</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1644
The love of the spouses requires, of its very nature, the unity and
indissolubility of the spouses' community of persons, which embraces their
entire life: &quot;so they are no longer two, but one flesh.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1W4 href=#$1W4>151</a></sup></font>
They &quot;are called to grow continually in their communion through day-to-day
fidelity to their marriage promise of total mutual
self-giving.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1W5 href=#$1W5>152</a></sup></font> This human communion is confirmed, purified, and
completed by communion in Jesus Christ, given through the sacrament of
Matrimony. It is deepened by lives of the common faith and by the Eucharist
received together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1645
&quot;The unity of marriage, distinctly recognized by our Lord, is made clear
in the equal personal dignity which must be accorded to man and wife in mutual
and unreserved affection.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1W6 href=#$1W6>153</a></sup></font> Polygamy is contrary to conjugal
love which is undivided and exclusive.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1W7 href=#$1W7>154</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
fidelity of conjugal love</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1646
By its very nature conjugal love requires the inviolable fidelity of the spouses.
This is the consequence of the gift of themselves which they make to each
other. Love seeks to be definitive; it cannot be an arrangement &quot;until
further notice.&quot; the &quot;intimate union of marriage, as a mutual giving
of two persons, and the good of the children, demand total fidelity from the
spouses and require an unbreakable union between them.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1W8 href=#$1W8>155</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1647
The deepest reason is found in the fidelity of God to his covenant, in that of
Christ to his Church. Through the sacrament of Matrimony the spouses are
enabled to represent this fidelity and witness to it. Through the sacrament,
the indissolubility of marriage receives a new and deeper meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1648
It can seem difficult, even impossible, to bind oneself for life to another
human being. This makes it all the more important to proclaim the Good News
that God loves us with a definitive and irrevocable love, that married couples
share in this love, that it supports and sustains them, and that by their own
faithfulness they can be witnesses to God's faithful love. Spouses who with
God's grace give this witness, often in very difficult conditions, deserve the
gratitude and support of the ecclesial community.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1W9 href=#$1W9>156</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1649
Yet
there are some situations in which living together becomes practically
impossible for a variety of reasons. In such cases the Church permits the
physical separation of the couple and their living apart. the spouses do not
cease to be husband and wife before God and so are not free to contract a new
union. In this difficult situation, the best solution would be, if possible,
reconciliation. the Christian community is called to help these persons live
out their situation in a Christian manner and in fidelity to their marriage bond
which remains indissoluble.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1WA href=#$1WA>157</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1650
Today
there are numerous Catholics in many countries who have recourse to civil
divorce and contract new civil unions. In fidelity to the words of Jesus Christ
- &quot;Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery against
her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits
adultery&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1WB href=#$1WB>158</a></sup></font> The Church maintains that a new union cannot be
recognized as valid, if the first marriage was. If the divorced are remarried
civilly, they find themselves in a situation that objectively contravenes God's
law. Consequently, they cannot receive Eucharistic communion as long as this
situation persists. For the same reason, they cannot exercise certain ecclesial
responsibilities. Reconciliation through the sacrament of Penance can be
granted only to those who have repented for having violated the sign of the
covenant and of fidelity to Christ, and who are committed to living in complete
continence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1651
Toward
Christians who live in this situation, and who often keep the faith and desire
to bring up their children in a Christian manner, priests and the whole
community must manifest an attentive solicitude, so that they do not consider
themselves separated from the Church, in whose life they can and must
participate as baptized persons:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>They should be encouraged to
listen to the Word of God, to attend the Sacrifice of the Mass, to persevere in
prayer, to contribute to works of charity and to community efforts for justice,
to bring up their children in the Christian faith, to cultivate the spirit and
practice of penance and thus implore, day by day, God's grace.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1WC href=#$1WC>159</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
openness to fertility</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1652
&quot;By its very nature the institution of marriage and married love is
ordered to the procreation and education of the offspring and it is in them
that it finds its crowning glory.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1WD href=#$1WD>160</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Children are the supreme gift
of marriage and contribute greatly to the good of the parents themselves. God himself
said: &quot;It is not good that man should be alone,&quot; and &quot;from the
beginning (he) made them male and female&quot;; wishing to associate them in a
special way in his own creative work, God blessed man and woman with the words:
&quot;Be fruitful and multiply.&quot; Hence, true married love and the whole
structure of family life which results from it, without diminishment of the
other ends of marriage, are directed to disposing the spouses to cooperate
valiantly with the love of the Creator and Savior, who through them will
increase and enrich his family from day to day.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1WE href=#$1WE>161</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1653
The fruitfulness of conjugal love extends to the fruits of the moral,
spiritual, and supernatural life that parents hand on to their children by
education. Parents are the principal and first educators of their
children.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1WF href=#$1WF>162</a></sup></font> In this sense the fundamental task of marriage and family
is to be at the service of life.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1WG href=#$1WG>163</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1654
Spouses to whom God has not granted children can nevertheless have a conjugal
life full of meaning, in both human and Christian terms. Their marriage can
radiate a fruitfulness of charity, of hospitality, and of sacrifice.</p>
