<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Paragraph 4. CHRIST'S FAITHFUL - HIERARCHY, LAITY,
CONSECRATED LIFE</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>871
&quot;The Christian faithful are those who, inasmuch as they have been
incorporated in Christ through Baptism, have been constituted as the people of
God; for this reason, since they have become sharers in Christ's priestly,
prophetic, and royal office in their own manner, they are called to exercise
the mission which God has entrusted to the Church to fulfill in the world, in
accord with the condition proper to each one.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15S href=#$15S>385</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>872
&quot;In virtue of their rebirth in Christ there exists among all the Christian
faithful a true equality with regard to dignity and the activity whereby all
cooperate in the building up of the Body of Christ in accord with each one's
own condition and function.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15T href=#$15T>386</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>873
The very differences which the Lord has willed to put between the members of
his body serve its unity and mission. For &quot;in the Church there is
diversity of ministry but unity of mission. To the apostles and their
successors Christ has entrusted the office of teaching, sanctifying and
governing in his name and by his power. But the laity are made to share in the
priestly, prophetical, and kingly office of Christ; they have therefore, in the
Church and in the world, their own assignment in the mission of the whole
People of God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15U href=#$15U>387</a></sup></font> Finally, &quot;from both groups [hierarchy and
laity] there exist Christian faithful who are consecrated to God in their own
special manner and serve the salvific mission of the Church through the profession
of the evangelical counsels.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15V href=#$15V>388</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. THE
HIERARCHICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why the
ecclesial ministry?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>874
Christ is himself the source of ministry in the Church. He instituted the
Church. He gave her authority and mission, orientation and goal:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>In order to shepherd the
People of God and to increase its numbers without cease, Christ the Lord set up
in his Church a variety of offices which aim at the good of the whole body. the
holders of office, who are invested with a sacred power, are, in fact,
dedicated to promoting the interests of their brethren, so that all who belong
to the People of God . . . may attain to salvation.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15W href=#$15W>389</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>875
&quot;How are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? and how are
they to hear without a preacher? and how can men preach unless they are
sent?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15X href=#$15X>390</a></sup></font> No one - no individual and no community - can proclaim
the Gospel to himself: &quot;Faith comes from what is heard.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15Y href=#$15Y>391</a></sup></font>
No one can give himself the mandate and the mission to proclaim the Gospel. the
one sent by the Lord does not speak and act on his own authority, but by virtue
of Christ's authority; not as a member of the community, but speaking to it in
the name of Christ. No one can bestow grace on himself; it must be given and
offered. This fact presupposes ministers of grace, authorized and empowered by
Christ. From him, they receive the mission and faculty (&quot;the sacred
power&quot;) to act in persona Christi Capitis. the ministry in which Christ's
emissaries do and give by God's grace what they cannot do and give by their own
powers, is called a &quot;sacrament&quot; by the Church's tradition. Indeed,
the ministry of the Church is conferred by a special sacrament.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>876
Intrinsically linked to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry is its
character as service. Entirely dependent on Christ who gives mission and
authority, ministers are truly &quot;slaves of Christ,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15Z href=#$15Z>392</a></sup></font> in the
image of him who freely took &quot;the form of a slave&quot; for us.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-160 href=#$160>393</a></sup></font>
Because the word and grace of which they are ministers are not their own, but
are given to them by Christ for the sake of others, they must freely become the
slaves of all.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-161 href=#$161>394</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>877
Likewise, it belongs to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry that it
have a collegial character. In fact, from the beginning of his ministry, the
Lord Jesus instituted the Twelve as &quot;the seeds of the new Israel and the
beginning of the sacred hierarchy.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-162 href=#$162>395</a></sup></font> Chosen together, they were
also sent out together, and their fraternal unity would be at the service of
the fraternal communion of all the faithful: they would reflect and witness to
the communion of the divine persons.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-163 href=#$163>396</a></sup></font> For this reason every bishop
exercises his ministry from within the episcopal college, in communion with the
bishop of Rome, the successor of St. Peter and head of the college. So also
priests exercise their ministry from within the presbyterium of the diocese,
under the direction of their bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>878
Finally, it belongs to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry that it
have a personal character. Although Chnst's ministers act in communion with one
another, they also always act in a personal way. Each one is called personally:
&quot;You, follow me&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-164 href=#$164>397</a></sup></font> in order to be a personal witness within
the common mission, to bear personal responsibility before him who gives the
mission, acting &quot;in his person&quot; and for other persons: &quot;I
baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
...&quot;; &quot;I absolve you....&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>879
Sacramental ministry in the Church, then, is at once a collegial and a personal
service, exercised in the name of Christ. This is evidenced by the bonds
between the episcopal college and its head, the successor of St. Peter, and in
the relationship between the bishop's pastoral responsibility for his
particular church and the common solicitude of the episcopal college for the
universal Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The episcopal
college and its head, the Pope</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>880
When Christ instituted the Twelve, &quot;he constituted [them] in the form of a
college or permanent assembly, at the head of which he placed Peter, chosen
from among them.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-165 href=#$165>398</a></sup></font> Just as &quot;by the Lord's institution, St.
Peter and the rest of the apostles constitute a single apostolic college, so in
like fashion the Roman Pontiff, Peter's successor, and the bishops, the
successors of the apostles, are related with and united to one
another.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-166 href=#$166>399</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>881
The Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the &quot;rock&quot; of his
Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the
whole flock.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-167 href=#$167>400</a></sup></font> &quot;The office of binding and loosing which was given
to Peter was also assigned to the college of apostles united to its
head.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-168 href=#$168>401</a></sup></font> This pastoral office of Peter and the other apostles
belongs to the Church's very foundation and is continued by the bishops under
the primacy of the Pope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>882
The Pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter's successor, &quot;is the perpetual and
visible source and foundation of the unity both of the bishops and of the whole
company of the faithful.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-169 href=#$169>402</a></sup></font> &quot;For the Roman Pontiff, by
reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire Church has
full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can
always exercise unhindered.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16A href=#$16A>403</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>883
&quot;The college or body of bishops has no authority unless united with the
Roman Pontiff, Peter's successor, as its head.&quot; As such, this college has
&quot;supreme and full authority over the universal Church; but this power
cannot be exercised without the agreement of the Roman
Pontiff.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16B href=#$16B>404</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>884
&quot;The college of bishops exercises power over the universal Church in a
solemn manner in an ecumenical council.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16C href=#$16C>405</a></sup></font> But &quot;there never
is an ecumenical council which is not confirmed or at least recognized as such
by Peter's successor.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16D href=#$16D>406</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>885
&quot;This college, in so far as it is composed of many members, is the
expression of the variety and universality of the People of God; and of the
unity of the flock of Christ, in so far as it is assembled under one
head.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16E href=#$16E>407</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>886
&quot;The individual bishops are the visible source and foundation of unity in
their own particular Churches.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16F href=#$16F>408</a></sup></font> As such, they &quot;exercise
their pastoral office over the portion of the People of God assigned to
them,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16G href=#$16G>409</a></sup></font> assisted by priests and deacons. But, as a member of the
episcopal college, each bishop shares in the concern for all the
Churches.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16H href=#$16H>410</a></sup></font> The bishops exercise this care first &quot;by ruling well
their own Churches as portions of the universal Church,&quot; and so
contributing &quot;to the welfare of the whole Mystical Body, which, from
another point of view, is a corporate body of Churches.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16I href=#$16I>411</a></sup></font> They
extend it especially to the poor,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16J href=#$16J>412</a></sup></font> to those persecuted for the faith,
as well as to missionaries who are working throughout the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>887
Neighboring particular Churches who share the same culture form ecclesiastical
provinces or larger groupings called patriarchates or regions.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16K href=#$16K>413</a></sup></font> The
bishops of these groupings can meet in synods or provincial councils. &quot;In
a like fashion, the episcopal conferences at the present time are in a position
to contribute in many and fruitful ways to the concrete realization of the
collegiate spirit.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16L href=#$16L>414</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
teaching office</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>888
Bishops, with priests as co-workers, have as their first task &quot;to preach
the Gospel of God to all men,&quot; in keeping with the Lord's
command.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16M href=#$16M>415</a></sup></font> They are &quot;heralds of faith, who draw new disciples to
Christ; they are authentic teachers&quot; of the apostolic faith &quot;endowed
with the authority of Christ.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16N href=#$16N>416</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>889
In order to preserve the Church in the purity of the faith handed on by the
apostles, Christ who is the Truth willed to confer on her a share in his own
infallibility. By a &quot;supernatural sense of faith&quot; the People of God,
under the guidance of the Church's living Magisterium, &quot;unfailingly
adheres to this faith.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16O href=#$16O>417</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>890
The mission of the Magisterium is linked to the definitive nature of the
covenant established by God with his people in Christ. It is this Magisterium's
task to preserve God's people from deviations and defections and to guarantee
them the objective possibility of professing the true faith without error.
Thus, the pastoral duty of the Magisterium is aimed at seeing to it that the
People of God abides in the truth that liberates. To fulfill this service,
Christ endowed the Church's shepherds with the charism of infallibility in
matters of faith and morals. the exercise of this charism takes several forms:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>891
&quot;The Roman Pontiff, head of the college of bishops, enjoys this
infallibility in virtue of his office, when, as supreme pastor and teacher of
all the faithful - who confirms his brethren in the faith he proclaims by a
definitive act a doctrine pertaining to faith or morals.... the infallibility
promised to the Church is also present in the body of bishops when, together
with Peter's successor, they exercise the supreme Magisterium,&quot; above all
in an Ecumenical Council.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16P href=#$16P>418</a></sup></font> When the Church through its supreme
Magisterium proposes a doctrine &quot;for belief as being divinely
revealed,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16Q href=#$16Q>419</a></sup></font> and as the teaching of Christ, the definitions
&quot;must be adhered to with the obedience of faith.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16R href=#$16R>420</a></sup></font> This
infallibility extends as far as the deposit of divine Revelation
itself.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16S href=#$16S>421</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>892
Divine assistance is also given to the successors of the apostles, teaching in
communion with the successor of Peter, and, in a particular way, to the bishop
of Rome, pastor of the whole Church, when, without arriving at an infallible
definition and without pronouncing in a &quot;definitive manner,&quot; they
propose in the exercise of the ordinary Magisterium a teaching that leads to
better understanding of Revelation in matters of faith and morals. To this
ordinary teaching the faithful &quot;are to adhere to it with religious
assent&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16T href=#$16T>422</a></sup></font> which, though distinct from the assent of faith, is
nonetheless an extension of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
sanctifying office</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>893
The bishop is &quot;the steward of the grace of the supreme
priesthood,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16U href=#$16U>423</a></sup></font> especially in the Eucharist which he offers
personally or whose offering he assures through the priests, his co-workers.
the Eucharist is the center of the life of the particular Church. the bishop
and priests sanctify the Church by their prayer and work, by their ministry of
the word and of the sacraments. They sanctify her by their example, &quot;not
as domineering over those in your charge but being examples to the
flock.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16V href=#$16V>424</a></sup></font> Thus, &quot;together with the flock entrusted to them,
they may attain to eternal life.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16W href=#$16W>425</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
governing office</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>894
&quot;The bishops, as vicars and legates of Christ, govern the particular
Churches assigned to them by their counsels, exhortations, and example, but
over and above that also by the authority and sacred power&quot; which indeed
they ought to exercise so as to edify, in the spirit of service which is that
of their Master.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16X href=#$16X>426</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>895
&quot;The power which they exercise personally in the name of Christ, is
proper, ordinary, and immediate, although its exercise is ultimately controlled
by the supreme authority of the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16Y href=#$16Y>427</a></sup></font> But the bishops should
not be thought of as vicars of the Pope. His ordinary and immediate authority
over the whole Church does not annul, but on the contrary confirms and defends
that of the bishops. Their authority must be exercised in communion with the
whole Church under the guidance of the Pope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>896
The Good Shepherd ought to be the model and &quot;form&quot; of the bishop's
pastoral office. Conscious of his own weaknesses, &quot;the bishop . . . can
have compassion for those who are ignorant and erring. He should not refuse to
listen to his subjects whose welfare he promotes as of his very own
children.... the faithful ... should be closely attached to the bishop as the
Church is to Jesus Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to the
Father&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16Z href=#$16Z>428</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Let all follow the bishop, as
Jesus Christ follows his Father, and the college of presbyters as the apostles;
respect the deacons as you do God's law. Let no one do anything concerning the
Church in separation from the bishop.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-170 href=#$170>429</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. THE LAY
FAITHFUL</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>897
&quot;The term 'laity' is here understood to mean all the faithful except those
in Holy Orders and those who belong to a religious state approved by the
Church. That is, the faithful, who by Baptism are incorporated into Christ and
integrated into the People of God, are made sharers in their particular way in
the priestly, prophetic, and kingly office of Christ, and have their own part
to play in the mission of the whole Christian people in the Church and in the
World.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-171 href=#$171>430</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
vocation of lay people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>898
&quot;By reason of their special vocation it belongs to the laity to seek the
kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and directing them according to
God's will.... It pertains to them in a special way so to illuminate and order
all temporal things with which they are closely associated that these may
always be effected and grow according to Christ and maybe to the glory of the
Creator and Redeemer.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-172 href=#$172>431</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>899
The initiative of lay Christians is necessary especially when the matter
involves discovering or inventing the means for permeating social, political, and
economic realities with the demands of Christian doctrine and life. This
initiative is a normal element of the life of the Church:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lay believers are in the front line of Church life; for them the Church
is the animating principle of human society. Therefore, they in particular
ought to have an ever-clearer consciousness not only of belonging to the
Church, but of being the Church, that is to say, the community of the faithful
on earth under the leadership of the Pope, the common Head, and of the bishops
in communion with him. They are the Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-173 href=#$173>432</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>900
Since, like all the faithful, lay Christians are entrusted by God with the
apostolate by virtue of their Baptism and Confirmation, they have the right and
duty, individually or grouped in associations, to work so that the divine
message of salvation may be known and accepted by all men throughout the earth.
This duty is the more pressing when it is only through them that men can hear
the Gospel and know Christ. Their activity in ecclesial communities is so
necessary that, for the most part, the apostolate of the pastors cannot be
fully effective without it.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-174 href=#$174>433</a></sup></font> <br>
The participation of lay people in Christ's priestly office</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>901
&quot;Hence the laity, dedicated as they are to Christ and anointed by the Holy
Spirit, are marvellously called and prepared so that even richer fruits of the
Spirit maybe produced in them. For all their works, prayers, and apostolic
undertakings, family and married life, daily work, relaxation of mind and body,
if they are accomplished in the Spirit - indeed even the hardships of life if
patiently born - all these become spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ. In the celebration of the Eucharist these may most
fittingly be offered to the Father along with the body of the Lord. and so,
worshipping everywhere by their holy actions, the laity consecrate the world
itself to God, everywhere offering worship by the holiness of their
lives.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-175 href=#$175>434</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>902
In a very
special way, parents share in the office of sanctifying &quot;by leading a
conjugal life in the Christian spirit and by seeing to the Christian education
of their children.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-176 href=#$176>435</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>903
Lay people who possess the required qualities can be admitted permanently to
the ministries of lector and acolyte.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-177 href=#$177>436</a></sup></font> When the necessity of the
Church warrants it and when ministers are lacking, lay persons, even if they
are not lectors or acolytes, can also supply for certain of their offices, namely,
to exercise the ministry of the word, to preside over liturgical prayers, to
confer Baptism, and to distribute Holy Communion in accord with the
prescriptions of law.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-178 href=#$178>437</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Participation
in Christ's prophetic office</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>904
&quot;Christ . . . fulfills this prophetic office, not only by the hierarchy .
. . but also by the laity. He accordingly both establishes them as witnesses
and provides them with the sense of the faith [sensus fidei] and the grace of
the word&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-179 href=#$179>438</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To teach in order to lead others to faith is the task of every preacher

Lay people also fulfill their prophetic mission by evangelization, &quot;that
is, the proclamation of Christ by word and the testimony of life.&quot; For lay
people, &quot;this evangelization . . . acquires a specific property and
peculiar efficacy because it is accomplished in the ordinary circumstances of
the world.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17B href=#$17B>440</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>This witness of life, however,
is not the sole element in the apostolate; the true apostle is on the lookout

<p class=MsoNormal>907
&quot;In
accord with the knowledge, competence, and preeminence which they possess, [lay
people] have the right and even at times a duty to manifest to the sacred
pastors their opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church, and
they have a right to make their opinion known to the other Christian faithful,
with due regard to the integrity of faith and morals and reverence toward their
pastors, and with consideration for the common good and the dignity of
persons.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17E href=#$17E>443</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Participation
in Christ's kingly office</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>908
By his obedience unto death,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17F href=#$17F>444</a></sup></font> Christ communicated to his disciples the
gift of royal freedom, so that they might &quot;by the self-abnegation of a
holy life, overcome the reign of sin in themselves&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17G href=#$17G>445</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>That man is rightly called a
king who makes his own body an obedient subject and, by governing himself with
suitable rigor, refuses to let his passions breed rebellion in his soul, for he
exercises a kind of royal power over himself. and because he knows how to rule
his own person as king, so too does he sit as its judge. He will not let
himself be imprisoned by sin, or thrown headlong into wickedness.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17H href=#$17H>446</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>909
&quot;Moreover, by uniting their forces let the laity so remedy the
institutions and conditions of the world when the latter are an inducement to
sin, that these may be conformed to the norms of justice, favoring rather than
hindering the practice of virtue. By so doing they will impregnate culture and
human works with a moral value.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17I href=#$17I>447</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>910
&quot;The laity can also feel called, or be in fact called, to cooperate with
their pastors in the service of the ecclesial community, for the sake of its
growth and life. This can be done through the exercise of different kinds of
ministries according to the grace and charisms which the Lord has been pleased
to bestow on them.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17J href=#$17J>448</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>911
In the
Church, &quot;lay members of the Christian faithful can cooperate in the
exercise of this power [of governance] in accord with the norm of
law.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17K href=#$17K>449</a></sup></font> and so the Church provides for their presence at
particular councils, diocesan synods, pastoral councils; the exercise in
solidum of the pastoral care of a parish, collaboration in finance committees,
and participation in ecclesiastical tribunals, etc.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17L href=#$17L>450</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>912
The faithful should &quot;distinguish carefully between the rights and the
duties which they have as belonging to the Church and those which fall to them
as members of the human society. They will strive to unite the two
harmoniously, remembering that in every temporal affair they are to be guided
by a Christian conscience, since no human activity, even of the temporal order,
can be withdrawn from God's dominion.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17M href=#$17M>451</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>913
&quot;Thus, every person, through these gifts given to him, is at once the
witness and the living instrument of the mission of the Church itself
'according to the measure of Christ's bestowal.&quot;'<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17N href=#$17N>452</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III. THE
CONSECRATED LIFE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>914
&quot;The state of life which is constituted by the profession of the
evangelical counsels, while not entering into the hierarchical structure of the
Church, belongs undeniably to her life and holiness.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17O href=#$17O>453</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Evangelical
counsels, consecrated life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>915
Christ proposes the evangelical counsels, in their great variety, to every
disciple. the perfection of charity, to which all the faithful are called,
entails for those who freely follow the call to consecrated life the obligation
of practicing chastity in celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom, poverty and
obedience. It is the profession of these counsels, within a permanent state of
life recognized by the Church, that characterizes the life consecrated to
God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17P href=#$17P>454</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>916
The religious state is thus one way of experiencing a &quot;more intimate&quot;
consecration, rooted in Baptism and dedicated totally to God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17Q href=#$17Q>455</a></sup></font> In the
consecrated life, Christ's faithful, moved by the Holy Spirit, propose to
follow Christ more nearly, to give themselves to God who is loved above all
and, pursuing the perfection of charity in the service of the Kingdom, to signify
and proclaim in the Church the glory of the world to come.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17R href=#$17R>456</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One great
tree, with many branches</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>917
&quot;From the God-given seed of the counsels a wonderful and wide-spreading
tree has grown up in the field of the Lord, branching out into various forms of
the religious life lived in solitude or in community. Different religious
families have come into existence in which spiritual resources are multiplied
for the progress in holiness of their members and for the good of the entire
Body of Christ.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17S href=#$17S>457</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>918
From
the very beginning of the Church there were men and women who set out to follow
Christ with greater liberty, and to imitate him more closely, by practicing the
evangelical counsels. They led lives dedicated to God, each in his own way.
Many of them, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, became hermits or
founded religious families. These the Church, by virtue of her authority,
gladly accepted and approved.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17T href=#$17T>458</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>919
Bishops will always strive to discern new gifts of consecrated life granted to
the Church by the Holy Spirit; the approval of new forms of consecrated life is
reserved to the Apostolic See.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17U href=#$17U>459</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
eremitic life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>920
Without always professing the three evangelical counsels publicly, hermits
&quot;devote their life to the praise of God and salvation of the world through
a stricter separation from the world, the silence of solitude and assiduous
prayer and penance.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17V href=#$17V>460</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>921
They manifest to everyone the interior aspect of the mystery of the Church,
that is, personal intimacy with Christ. Hidden from the eyes of men, the life
of the hermit is a silent preaching of the Lord, to whom he has surrendered his
life simply because he is everything to him. Here is a particular call to find
in the desert, in the thick of spiritual battle, the glory of the Crucified
One.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consecrated
virgins</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>922
From apostolic times Christian virgins, called by the Lord to cling only to him
with greater freedom of heart, body, and spirit, have decided with the Church's
approval to live in a state of virginity &quot;for the sake of the Kingdom of
heaven.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17W href=#$17W>461</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>923
&quot;Virgins who, committed to the holy plan of following Christ more closely,
are consecrated to God by the diocesan bishop according to the approved
liturgical rite, are betrothed mystically to Christ, the Son of God, and are
dedicated to the service of the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17X href=#$17X>462</a></sup></font> By this solemn rite
(Consecratio virginum), the virgin is &quot;constituted . . . a sacred person,
a transcendent sign of the Church's love for Christ, and an eschatological
image of this heavenly Bride of Christ and of the life to
come.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17Y href=#$17Y>463</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>924
&quot;As with other forms of consecrated life,&quot; the order of virgins
establishes the woman living in the world (or the nun) in prayer, penance,
service of her brethren, and apostolic activity, according to the state of life
and spiritual gifts given to her.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-17Z href=#$17Z>464</a></sup></font> Consecrated virgins can form
themselves into associations to observe their commitment more
faithfully.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-180 href=#$180>465</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Religious
life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>925
Religious life was born in the East during the first centuries of Christianity.
Lived within institutes canonically erected by the Church, it is distinguished
from other forms of consecrated life by its liturgical character, public
profession of the evangelical counsels, fraternal life led in common, and
witness given to the union of Christ with the Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-181 href=#$181>466</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>926
Religious life derives from the mystery of the Church. It is a gift she has
received from her Lord, a gift she offers as a stable way of life to the
faithful called by God to profess the counsels. Thus, the Church can both show
forth Christ and acknowledge herself to be the Savior's bride. Religious life
in its various forms is called to signify the very charity of God in the
language of our time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>927
All religious, whether exempt or not, take their place among the collaborators
of the diocesan bishop in his pastoral duty.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-182 href=#$182>467</a></sup></font> From the outset of the
work of evangelization, the missionary &quot;planting&quot; and expansion of
the Church require the presence of the religious life in all its
forms.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-183 href=#$183>468</a></sup></font> &quot;History witnesses to the outstanding service rendered
by religious families in the propagation of the faith and in the formation of
new Churches: from the ancient monastic institutions to the medieval orders,
all the way to the more recent congregations.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-184 href=#$184>469</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Secular
institutes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>928
&quot;A secular institute is an institute of consecrated life in which the
Christian faithful living in the world strive for the perfection of charity and
work for the sanctification of the world especially from
within.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-185 href=#$185>470</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>929
By a &quot;life perfectly and entirely consecrated to [such]
sanctification,&quot; the members of these institutes share in the Church's
task of evangelization, &quot;in the world and from within the world,&quot;
where their presence acts as &quot;leaven in the world.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-186 href=#$186>471</a></sup></font>
&quot;Their witness of a Christian life&quot; aims &quot;to order temporal
things according to God and inform the world with the power of the
gospel.&quot; They commit themselves to the evangelical counsels by sacred
bonds and observe among themselves the communion and fellowship appropriate to
their &quot;particular secular way of life.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-187 href=#$187>472</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Societies
of apostolic life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>930
Alongside the different forms of consecrated life are &quot;societies of apostolic
life whose members without religious vows pursue the particular apostolic
purpose of their society, and lead a life as brothers or sisters in common
according to a particular manner of life, strive for the perfection of charity
through the observance of the constitutions. Among these there are societies in
which the members embrace the evangelical counsels&quot; according to their
constitutions.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-188 href=#$188>473</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consecration
and mission: proclaiming the King who is corning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>931
Already dedicated to him through Baptism, the person who surrenders himself to
the God he loves above all else thereby consecrates himself more intimately to
God's service and to the good of the Church. By this state of life consecrated
to God, the Church manifests Christ and shows us how the Holy Spirit acts so
wonderfully in her. and so the first mission of those who profess the
evangelical counsels is to live out their consecration. Moreover, &quot;since
members of institutes of consecrated life dedicate themselves through their
consecration to the service of the Church they are obliged in a special manner
to engage in missionary work, in accord with the character of the
institute.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-189 href=#$189>474</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>932
In the Church, which is like the sacrament - the sign and instrument - of God's
own life, the consecrated life is seen as a special sign of the mystery of
redemption. To follow and imitate Christ more nearly and to manifest more
clearly his self-emptying is to be more deeply present to one's contemporaries,
in the heart of Christ. For those who are on this &quot;narrower&quot; path
encourage their brethren by their example, and bear striking witness &quot;that
the world cannot be transfigured and offered to God without the spirit of the
beatitudes.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-18A href=#$18A>475</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>933
Whether their witness is public, as in the religious state, or less public, or
even secret, Christ's coming remains for all those consecrated both the origin
and rising sun of their life:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the People of God has here no lasting city, . . . [and this state]
reveals more clearly to all believers the heavenly goods which are already
present in this age, witnessing to the new and eternal life which we have
acquired through the redemptive work of Christ and preluding our future
resurrection and the glory of the heavenly kingdom.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-18B href=#$18B>476</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>934 &quot;Among the Christian
faithful by divine institution there exist in the Church sacred ministers, who
are also called clerics in law, and other Christian faithful who are also
called laity.&quot; In both groups there are those Christian faithful who,
professing the evangelical counsels, are consecrated to God and so serve the
Church's saving mission (cf. <A target=_blank href=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_PU.HTM#2.1.0.0.0.0.207><b>&#8658;</b></A> CIC, can. 207 # 1,
