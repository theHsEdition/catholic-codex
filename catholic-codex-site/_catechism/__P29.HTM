<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Paragraph 3. THE CHURCH IS ONE, HOLY, CATHOLIC,
AND APOSTOLIC</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>811
&quot;This is the sole Church of Christ, which in the Creed we profess to be
one, holy, catholic and apostolic.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-127 href=#$127>256</a></sup></font> These four characteristics,
inseparably linked with each other,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-128 href=#$128>257</a></sup></font> indicate essential features of
the Church and her mission. the Church does not possess them of herself; it is
Christ who, through the Holy Spirit, makes his Church one, holy, catholic, and
apostolic, and it is he who calls her to realize each of these qualities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>812
Only faith can recognize that the Church possesses these properties from her
divine source. But their historical manifestations are signs that also speak
clearly to human reason. As the First Vatican Council noted, the &quot;Church
herself, with her marvellous propagation, eminent holiness, and inexhaustible
fruitfulness in everything good, her catholic unity and invincible stability,
is a great and perpetual motive of credibility and an irrefutable witness of
her divine mission.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-129 href=#$129>258</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. THE
CHURCH IS ONE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The sacred
mystery of the Church's unity&quot; (UR 2)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>813
The Church is one because of her source: &quot;the highest exemplar and source
of this mystery is the unity, in the Trinity of Persons, of one God, the Father
and the Son in the Holy Spirit.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12A href=#$12A>259</a></sup></font> The Church is one because of
her founder: for &quot;the Word made flesh, the prince of peace, reconciled all
men to God by the cross, . . . restoring the unity of all in one people and one
body.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12B href=#$12B>260</a></sup></font> The Church is one because of her &quot;soul&quot;:
&quot;It is the Holy Spirit, dwelling in those who believe and pervading and
ruling over the entire Church, who brings about that wonderful communion of the
faithful and joins them together so intimately in Christ that he is the
principle of the Church's unity.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12C href=#$12C>261</a></sup></font> Unity is of the essence of
the Church:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>What an astonishing mystery!
There is one Father of the universe, one Logos of the universe, and also one
Holy Spirit, everywhere one and the same; there is also one virgin become
mother, and I should like to call her &quot;Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12D href=#$12D>262</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>814
From the beginning, this one Church has been marked by a great diversity which
comes from both the variety of God's gifts and the diversity of those who
receive them. Within the unity of the People of God, a multiplicity of peoples
and cultures is gathered together. Among the Church's members, there are
different gifts, offices, conditions, and ways of life. &quot;Holding a
rightful place in the communion of the Church there are also particular
Churches that retain their own traditions.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12E href=#$12E>263</a></sup></font> The great richness
of such diversity is not opposed to the Church's unity. Yet sin and the burden
of its consequences constantly threaten the gift of unity. and so the Apostle
has to exhort Christians to &quot;maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12F href=#$12F>264</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>815
What are these bonds of unity? Above all, charity &quot;binds everything
together in perfect harmony.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12G href=#$12G>265</a></sup></font> But the unity of the pilgrim
Church is also assured by visible bonds of communion: <br>
- profession of one faith received from the Apostles; <br>
-common celebration of divine worship, especially of the sacraments; <br>
- apostolic succession through the sacrament of Holy Orders, maintaining the
fraternal concord of God's family.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12H href=#$12H>266</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>816
&quot;The sole Church of Christ [is that] which our Savior, after his
Resurrection, entrusted to Peter's pastoral care, commissioning him and the
other apostles to extend and rule it.... This Church, constituted and organized
as a society in the present world, subsists in (subsistit in) in) the Catholic
Church, which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the bishops in
communion with him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12I href=#$12I>267</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The Second Vatican Council's
Decree on Ecumenism explains: &quot;For it is through Christ's Catholic Church
alone, which is the universal help toward salvation, that the fullness of the
means of salvation can be obtained. It was to the apostolic college alone, of
which Peter is the head, that we believe that our Lord entrusted all the blessings
of the New Covenant, in order to establish on earth the one Body of Christ into
which all those should be fully incorporated who belong in any way to the
People of God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12J href=#$12J>268</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wounds to
unity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>817
In fact, &quot;in this one and only Church of God from its very beginnings
there arose certain rifts, which the Apostle strongly censures as damnable. But
in subsequent centuries much more serious dissensions appeared and large
communities became separated from full communion with the Catholic Church - for
which, often enough, men of both sides were to blame.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12K href=#$12K>269</a></sup></font> The
ruptures that wound the unity of Christ's Body - here we must distinguish
heresy, apostasy, and schism<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12L href=#$12L>270</a></sup></font> - do not occur without human sin:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Where there are sins, there
are also divisions, schisms, heresies, and disputes. Where there is virtue,
however, there also are harmony and unity, from which arise the one heart and
one soul of all believers.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12M href=#$12M>271</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>818
&quot;However, one cannot charge with the sin of the separation those who at
present are born into these communities [that resulted from such separation]
and in them are brought up in the faith of Christ, and the Catholic Church
accepts them with respect and affection as brothers .... All who have been
justified by faith in Baptism are incorporated into Christ; they therefore have
a right to be called Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers
in the Lord by the children of the Catholic Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12N href=#$12N>272</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>819
&quot;Furthermore, many elements of sanctification and of
truth&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12O href=#$12O>273</a></sup></font> are found outside the visible confines of the Catholic
Church: &quot;the written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope, and
charity, with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as visible
elements.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12P href=#$12P>274</a></sup></font> Christ's Spirit uses these Churches and ecclesial
communities as means of salvation, whose power derives from the fullness of
grace and truth that Christ has entrusted to the Catholic Church. All these
blessings come from Christ and lead to him,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12Q href=#$12Q>275</a></sup></font> and are in themselves
calls to &quot;Catholic unity.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12R href=#$12R>276</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Toward
unity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>820
&quot;Christ bestowed unity on his Church from the beginning. This unity, we
believe, subsists in the Catholic Church as something she can never lose, and
we hope that it will continue to increase until the end of
time.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12S href=#$12S>277</a></sup></font> Christ always gives his Church the gift of unity, but
the Church must always pray and work to maintain, reinforce, and perfect the
unity that Christ wills for her. This is why Jesus himself prayed at the hour
of his Passion, and does not cease praying to his Father, for the unity of his
disciples: &quot;That they may all be one. As you, Father, are in me and I am
in you, may they also be one in us, . . . so that the world may know that you
have sent me.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12T href=#$12T>278</a></sup></font> The desire to recover the unity of all
Christians is a gift of Christ and a call of the Holy Spirit.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12U href=#$12U>279</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>821
Certain
things are required in order to respond adequately to this call: <br>
- a permanent renewal of the Church in greater fidelity to her vocation; such
renewal is the driving-force of the movement toward unity;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12V href=#$12V>280</a></sup></font> <br>
- conversion of heart as the faithful &quot;try to live holier lives according
to the Gospel&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12W href=#$12W>281</a></sup></font> for it is the unfaithfulness of the members to
Christ's gift which causes divisions; <br>
- prayer in common, because &quot;change of heart and holiness of life, along
with public and private prayer for the unity of Christians, should be regarded
as the soul of the whole ecumenical movement, and merits the name 'spiritual
ecumenism;&quot;'<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12X href=#$12X>282</a></sup></font> <br>
-fraternal knowledge of each other;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12Y href=#$12Y>283</a></sup></font> <br>
- ecumenical formation of the faithful and especially of priests;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12Z href=#$12Z>284</a></sup></font> <br>
- dialogue among theologians and meetings among Christians of the different
churches and communities;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-130 href=#$130>285</a></sup></font> <br>
- collaboration among Christians in various areas of service to
mankind.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-131 href=#$131>286</a></sup></font> &quot;Human service&quot; is the idiomatic phrase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>822
Concern for achieving unity &quot;involves the whole Church, faithful and
clergy alike.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-132 href=#$132>287</a></sup></font> But we must realize &quot;that this holy
objective - the reconciliation of all Christians in the unity of the one and
only Church of Christ - transcends human powers and gifts.&quot; That is why we
place all our hope &quot;in the prayer of Christ for the Church, in the love of
the Father for us, and in the power of the Holy Spirit.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-133 href=#$133>288</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II THE
CHURCH IS HOLY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>823
&quot;The Church . . . is held, as a matter of faith, to be unfailingly holy.
This is because Christ, the Son of God, who with the Father and the Spirit is
hailed as 'alone holy,' loved the Church as his Bride, giving himself up for
her so as to sanctify her; he joined her to himself as his body and endowed her
with the gift of the Holy Spirit for the glory of God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-134 href=#$134>289</a></sup></font> The
Church, then, is &quot;the holy People of God,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-135 href=#$135>290</a></sup></font> and her members
are called &quot;saints.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-136 href=#$136>291</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>824
United with Christ, the Church is sanctified by him; through him and with him
she becomes sanctifying. &quot;All the activities of the Church are directed,
as toward their end, to the sanctification of men in Christ and the
glorification of God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-137 href=#$137>292</a></sup></font> It is in the Church that &quot;the
fullness of the means of salvation&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-138 href=#$138>293</a></sup></font> has been deposited. It is
in her that &quot;by the grace of God we acquire holiness.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-139 href=#$139>294</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>825
&quot;The Church on earth is endowed already with a sanctity that is real
though imperfect.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13A href=#$13A>295</a></sup></font> In her members perfect holiness is something
yet to be acquired: &quot;Strengthened by so many and such great means of
salvation, all the faithful, whatever their condition or state - though each in
his own way - are called by the Lord to that perfection of sanctity by which
the Father himself is perfect.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13B href=#$13B>296</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>826
Charity is the soul of the holiness to which all are called: it &quot;governs,
shapes, and perfects all the means of sanctification.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13C href=#$13C>297</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>If the Church was a body
composed of different members, it couldn't lack the noblest of all; it must
have a Heart, and a Heart BURNING WITH LOVE. <br>
and I realized that this love alone was the true motive force which enabled the
other members of the Church to act; if it ceased to function, the Apostles
would forget to preach the gospel, the Martyrs would refuse to shed their
blood. <br>
LOVE, IN FACT, IS THE VOCATION WHICH INCLUDES ALL OTHERS; IT'S A UNIVERSE OF
ITS OWN, COMPRISING ALL TIME AND SPACE - IT'S ETERNAL!<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13D href=#$13D>298</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>827
&quot;Christ, 'holy, innocent, and undefiled,' knew nothing of sin, but came
only to expiate the sins of the people. the Church, however, clasping sinners
to her bosom, at once holy and always in need of purification, follows
constantly the path of penance and renewal.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13E href=#$13E>299</a></sup></font> All members of the
Church, including her ministers, must acknowledge that they are
sinners.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13F href=#$13F>300</a></sup></font> In everyone, the weeds of sin will still be mixed with the
good wheat of the Gospel until the end of time.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13G href=#$13G>301</a></sup></font> Hence the Church
gathers sinners already caught up in Christ's salvation but still on the way to
holiness:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The Church is therefore holy,
though having sinners in her midst, because she herself has no other life but
the life of grace. If they live her life, her members are sanctified; if they
move away from her life, they fall into sins and disorders that prevent the
radiation of her sanctity. This is why she suffers and does penance for those
offenses, of which she has the power to free her children through the blood of
Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13H href=#$13H>302</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>828
By canonizing some of the faithful, i.e., by solemnly pro claiming that they
practiced heroic virtue and lived in fidelity to God's grace, the Church
recognizes the power of the Spirit of holiness within her and sustains the hope
of believers by proposing the saints to them as models and
intercessors.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13I href=#$13I>303</a></sup></font> &quot;The saints have always been the source and
origin of renewal in the most difficult moments in the Church's
history.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13J href=#$13J>304</a></sup></font> Indeed, &quot;holiness is the hidden source and
infallible measure of her apostolic activity and missionary
zeal.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13K href=#$13K>305</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>829
&quot;But while in the most Blessed Virgin the Church has already reached that
perfection whereby she exists without spot or wrinkle, the faithful still
strive to conquer sin and increase in holiness. and so they turn their eyes to
Mary&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13L href=#$13L>306</a></sup></font> in her, the Church is already the &quot;all-holy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III. THE
CHURCH IS CATHOLIC</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does
&quot;catholic&quot; mean?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>830
The word &quot;catholic&quot; means &quot;universal,&quot; in the sense of
&quot;according to the totality&quot; or &quot;in keeping with the whole.&quot;
the Church is catholic in a double sense: First, the Church is catholic because
Christ is present in her. &quot;Where there is Christ Jesus, there is the Catholic
Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13M href=#$13M>307</a></sup></font> In her subsists the fullness of Christ's body united
with its head; this implies that she receives from him &quot;the fullness of
the means of salvation&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13N href=#$13N>308</a></sup></font> which he has willed: correct and
complete confession of faith, full sacramental life, and ordained ministry in
apostolic succession. the Church was, in this fundamental sense, catholic on
the day of Pentecost<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13O href=#$13O>309</a></sup></font> and will always be so until the day of the
Parousia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>831
Secondly, the Church is catholic because she has been sent out by Christ on a
mission to the whole of the human race:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13P href=#$13P>310</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>All men are called to belong
to the new People of God. This People, therefore, while remaining one and only
one, is to be spread throughout the whole world and to all ages in order that the
design of God's will may be fulfilled: he made human nature one in the
beginning and has decreed that all his children who were scattered should be
finally gathered together as one.... the character of universality which adorns
the People of God is a gift from the Lord himself whereby the Catholic Church
ceaselessly and efficaciously seeks for the return of all humanity and all its
goods, under Christ the Head in the unity of his Spirit.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13Q href=#$13Q>311</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each
particular Church is &quot;catholic&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>832
&quot;The Church of Christ is really present in all legitimately organized
local groups of the faithful, which, in so far as they are united to their
pastors, are also quite appropriately called Churches in the New Testament....
In them the faithful are gathered together through the preaching of the Gospel
of Christ, and the mystery of the Lord's Supper is celebrated.... In these
communities, though they may often be small and poor, or existing in the
diaspora, Christ is present, through whose power and influence the One, Holy,
Catholic, and Apostolic Church is constituted.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13R href=#$13R>312</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>833
The phrase &quot;particular church,&quot; which is the diocese (or eparchy),
refers to a community of the Christian faithful in communion of faith and
sacraments with their bishop ordained in apostolic succession.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13S href=#$13S>313</a></sup></font> These
particular Churches &quot;are constituted after the model of the universal
Church; it is in these and formed out of them that the one and unique Catholic
Church exists.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13T href=#$13T>314</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>834
Particular Churches are fully catholic through their communion with one of
them, the Church of Rome &quot;which presides in charity.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13U href=#$13U>315</a></sup></font>
&quot;For with this church, by reason of its pre-eminence, the whole Church,
that is the faithful everywhere, must necessarily be in
accord.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13V href=#$13V>316</a></sup></font> Indeed, &quot;from the incarnate Word's descent to us,
all Christian churches everywhere have held and hold the great Church that is
here [at Rome] to be their only basis and foundation since, according to the
Savior's promise, the gates of hell have never prevailed against
her.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13W href=#$13W>317</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>835
&quot;Let
us be very careful not to conceive of the universal Church as the simple sum,
or . . . the more or less anomalous federation of essentially different particular
churches. In the mind of the Lord the Church is universal by vocation and
mission, but when she pub down her roots in a variety of cultural, social, and
human terrains, she takes on different external expressions and appearances in
each part of the world.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13X href=#$13X>318</a></sup></font> The rich variety of ecclesiastical
disciplines, liturgical rites, and theological and spiritual heritages proper
to the local churches &quot;unified in a common effort, shows all the more
resplendently the catholicity of the undivided Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13Y href=#$13Y>319</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who belongs
to the Catholic Church?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>836
&quot;All men are called to this catholic unity of the People of God.... and to
it, in different ways, belong or are ordered: the Catholic faithful, others who
believe in Christ, and finally all mankind, called by God's grace to
salvation.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13Z href=#$13Z>320</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>837
&quot;Fully incorporated into the society of the Church are those who,
possessing the Spirit of Christ, accept all the means of salvation given to the
Church together with her entire organization, and who - by the bonds
constituted by the profession of faith, the sacraments, ecclesiastical
government, and communion - are joined in the visible structure of the Church
of Christ, who rules her through the Supreme Pontiff and the bishops. Even
though incorporated into the Church, one who does not however persevere in
charity is not saved. He remains indeed in the bosom of the Church, but 'in
body' not 'in heart.'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-140 href=#$140>321</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>838
&quot;The Church knows that she is joined in many ways to the baptized who are
honored by the name of Christian, but do not profess the Catholic faith in its
entirety or have not preserved unity or communion under the successor of
Peter.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-141 href=#$141>322</a></sup></font> Those &quot;who believe in Christ and have been
properly baptized are put in a certain, although imperfect, communion with the
Catholic Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-142 href=#$142>323</a></sup></font> With the Orthodox Churches, this communion is
so profound &quot;that it lacks little to attain the fullness that would permit
a common celebration of the Lord's Eucharist.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-143 href=#$143>324</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church
and non-Christians</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>839
&quot;Those who have not yet received the Gospel are related to the People of
God in various ways.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-144 href=#$144>325</a></sup></font> <br>
The relationship of the Church with the Jewish People. When she delves into her
own mystery, the Church, the People of God in the New Covenant, discovers her
link with the Jewish People,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-145 href=#$145>326</a></sup></font> &quot;the first to hear the Word of
God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-146 href=#$146>327</a></sup></font> The Jewish faith, unlike other non-Christian religions,
is already a response to God's revelation in the Old Covenant. To the Jews
&quot;belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the
worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race,
according to the flesh, is the Christ&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-147 href=#$147>328</a></sup></font> &quot;for the gifts and
the call of God are irrevocable.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-148 href=#$148>329</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>840
and when one considers the future, God's People of the Old Covenant and the new
People of God tend towards similar goals: expectation of the coming (or the
return) of the Messiah. But one awaits the return of the Messiah who died and
rose from the dead and is recognized as Lord and Son of God; the other awaits
the coming of a Messiah, whose features remain hidden till the end of time; and
the latter waiting is accompanied by the drama of not knowing or of
misunderstanding Christ Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>841
The Church's relationship with the Muslims. &quot;The plan of salvation also
includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in the first place amongst whom are
the Muslims; these profess to hold the faith of Abraham, and together with us
they adore the one, merciful God, mankind's judge on the last
day.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-149 href=#$149>330</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>842
The Church's bond with non-Christian religions is in the first place the common
origin and end of the human race:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All nations form but one community. This is so because all stem from the
one stock which God created to people the entire earth, and also because all
share a common destiny, namely God. His providence, evident goodness, and
saving designs extend to all against the day when the elect are gathered
together in the holy city. . .<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14A href=#$14A>331</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>843
The Catholic Church recognizes in other religions that search, among shadows
and images, for the God who is unknown yet near since he gives life and breath
and all things and wants all men to be saved. Thus, the Church considers all
goodness and truth found in these religions as &quot;a preparation for the
Gospel and given by him who enlightens all men that they may at length have
life.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14B href=#$14B>332</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>844
In their religious behavior, however, men also display the limits and errors
that disfigure the image of God in them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Very often, deceived by the
Evil One, men have become vain in their reasonings, and have exchanged the
truth of God for a lie, and served the creature rather than the Creator. Or
else, living and dying in this world without God, they are exposed to ultimate
despair.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14C href=#$14C>333</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>845
To reunite all his children, scattered and led astray by sin, the Father willed
to call the whole of humanity together into his Son's Church. the Church is the
place where humanity must rediscover its unity and salvation. the Church is
&quot;the world reconciled.&quot; She is that bark which &quot;in the full sail
of the Lord's cross, by the breath of the Holy Spirit, navigates safely in this
world.&quot; According to another image dear to the Church Fathers, she is
prefigured by Noah's ark, which alone saves from the flood.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14D href=#$14D>334</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Outside
the Church there is no salvation&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>846
How are we to understand this affirmation, often repeated by the Church
Fathers?<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14E href=#$14E>335</a></sup></font> Re-formulated positively, it means that all salvation comes
from Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Basing itself on Scripture and
Tradition, the Council teaches that the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is
necessary for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of
salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself
explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at
the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as
through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic
Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to
enter it or to remain in it.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14F href=#$14F>336</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>847
This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do
not know Christ and his Church:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Those who, through no fault of
their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless
seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do
his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too
may achieve eternal salvation.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14G href=#$14G>337</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>848
&quot;Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who, through no
fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel, to that faith without which it
is impossible to please him, the Church still has the obligation and also the sacred
right to evangelize all men.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14H href=#$14H>338</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mission - a
requirement of the Church's catholicity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>849
The missionary mandate. &quot;Having been divinely sent to the nations that she
might be 'the universal sacrament of salvation,' the Church, in obedience to
the command of her founder and because it is demanded by her own essential
universality, strives to preach the Gospel to all men&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14I href=#$14I>339</a></sup></font>
&quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to
observe all that I have commanded you; and Lo, I am with you always, until the
close of the age.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14J href=#$14J>340</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>850
The origin and purpose of mission. the Lord's missionary mandate is ultimately
grounded in the eternal love of the Most Holy Trinity: &quot;The Church on
earth is by her nature missionary since, according to the plan of the Father,
she has as her origin the mission of the Son and the Holy
Spirit.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14K href=#$14K>341</a></sup></font> The ultimate purpose of mission is none other than to
make men share in the communion between the Father and the Son in their Spirit
of love.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14L href=#$14L>342</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>851
Missionary motivation. It is from God's love for all men that the Church in
every age receives both the obligation and the vigor of her missionary
dynamism, &quot;for the love of Christ urges us on.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14M href=#$14M>343</a></sup></font> Indeed,
God &quot;desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the
truth&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14N href=#$14N>344</a></sup></font> that is, God wills the salvation of everyone through
the knowledge of the truth. Salvation is found in the truth. Those who obey the
prompting of the Spirit of truth are already on the way of salvation. But the
Church, to whom this truth has been entrusted, must go out to meet their
desire, so as to bring them the truth. Because she believes in God's universal
plan of salvation, the Church must be missionary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>852
Missionary paths. the Holy Spirit is the protagonist, &quot;the principal agent
of the whole of the Church's mission.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14O href=#$14O>345</a></sup></font> It is he who leads the
Church on her missionary paths. &quot;This mission continues and, in the course
of history, unfolds the mission of Christ, who was sent to evangelize the poor;
so the Church, urged on by the Spirit of Christ, must walk the road Christ
himself walked, a way of poverty and obedience, of service and self-sacrifice
even to death, a death from which he emerged victorious by his
resurrection.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14P href=#$14P>346</a></sup></font> So it is that &quot;the blood of martyrs is the
seed of Christians.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14Q href=#$14Q>347</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>853
On her
pilgrimage, the Church has also experienced the &quot;discrepancy existing
between the message she proclaims and the human weakness of those to whom the
Gospel has been entrusted.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14R href=#$14R>348</a></sup></font> Only by taking the &quot;way of
penance and renewal,&quot; the &quot;narrow way of the cross,&quot; can the
People of God extend Christ's reign.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14S href=#$14S>349</a></sup></font> For &quot;just as Christ
carried out the work of redemption in poverty and oppression, so the Church is
called to follow the same path if she is to communicate the fruits of salvation
to men.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14T href=#$14T>350</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>854
By her
very mission, &quot;the Church . . . travels the same journey as all humanity
and shares the same earthly lot with the world: she is to be a leaven and, as
it were, the soul of human society in its renewal by Christ and transformation
into the family of God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14U href=#$14U>351</a></sup></font> Missionary endeavor requires patience.
It begins with the proclamation of the Gospel to peoples and groups who do not
yet believe in Christ,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14V href=#$14V>352</a></sup></font> continues with the establishment of Christian
communities that are &quot;a sign of God's presence in the
world,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14W href=#$14W>353</a></sup></font> and leads to the foundation of local
churches.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14X href=#$14X>354</a></sup></font> It must involve a process of inculturation if the Gospel
is to take flesh in each people's culture.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14Y href=#$14Y>355</a></sup></font> There will be times of
defeat. &quot;With regard to individuals, groups, and peoples it is only by
degrees that [the Church] touches and penetrates them and so receives them into
a fullness which is Catholic.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14Z href=#$14Z>356</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>855
The
Church's mission stimulates efforts towards Christian unity.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-150 href=#$150>357</a></sup></font> Indeed,
&quot;divisions among Christians prevent the Church from realizing in practice
the fullness of catholicity proper to her in those of her sons who, though
joined to her by Baptism, are yet separated from full communion with her.
Furthermore, the Church herself finds it more difficult to express in actual
life her full catholicity in all its aspects.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-151 href=#$151>358</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>856
The
missionary task implies a respectful dialogue with those who do not yet accept
the Gospel.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-152 href=#$152>359</a></sup></font> Believers can profit from this dialogue by learning to
appreciate better &quot;those elements of truth and grace which are found among
peoples, and which are, as it were, a secret presence of God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-153 href=#$153>360</a></sup></font>
They proclaim the Good News to those who do not know it, in order to
consolidate, complete, and raise up the truth and the goodness that God has
distributed among men and nations, and to purify them from error and evil
&quot;for the glory of God, the confusion of the demon, and the happiness of man.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-154 href=#$154>361</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IV. THE
CHURCH IS APOSTOLIC</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>857
The Church is apostolic because she is founded on the apostles, in three ways: <br>
- she was and remains built on &quot;the foundation of the
Apostles,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-155 href=#$155>362</a></sup></font> The witnesses chosen and sent on mission by Christ
himself;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-156 href=#$156>363</a></sup></font> <br>
- with the help of the Spirit dwelling in her, the Church keeps and hands on
the teaching,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-157 href=#$157>364</a></sup></font> The &quot;good deposit,&quot; the salutary words she
has heard from the apostles;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-158 href=#$158>365</a></sup></font> <br>
- she continues to be taught, sanctified, and guided by the apostles until
Christ's return, through their successors in pastoral office: the college of
bishops, &quot;assisted by priests, in union with the successor of Peter, the
Church's supreme pastor&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-159 href=#$159>366</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>You are the eternal Shepherd</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>who never leaves his flock
untended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Through the apostles you watch
over us and protect us always.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>You made them shepherds of the
flock</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>to share in the work of your
Son....<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15A href=#$15A>367</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
Apostles' mission</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>858
Jesus is the Father's Emissary. From the beginning of his ministry, he
&quot;called to him those whom he desired; .... and he appointed twelve, whom
also he named apostles, to be with him, and to be sent out to
preach.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15B href=#$15B>368</a></sup></font> From then on, they would also be his &quot;emissaries&quot;
(Greek apostoloi). In them, Christ continues his own mission: &quot;As the
Father has sent me, even so I send you.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15C href=#$15C>369</a></sup></font> The apostles' ministry
is the continuation of his mission; Jesus said to the Twelve: &quot;he who
receives you receives me.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15D href=#$15D>370</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>859
Jesus unites them to the mission he received from the Father. As &quot;the Son
can do nothing of his own accord,&quot; but receives everything from the Father
who sent him, so those whom Jesus sends can do nothing apart from
him,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15E href=#$15E>371</a></sup></font> from whom they received both the mandate for their mission and
the power to carry it out. Christ's apostles knew that they were called by God
as &quot;ministers of a new covenant,&quot; &quot;servants of God,&quot;
&quot;ambassadors for Christ,&quot; &quot;servants of Christ and stewards of
the mysteries of God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15F href=#$15F>372</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>860
In the office of the apostles there is one aspect that cannot be transmitted:
to be the chosen witnesses of the Lord's Resurrection and so the foundation
stones of the Church. But their office also has a permanent aspect. Christ
promised to remain with them always. the divine mission entrusted by Jesus to
them &quot;will continue to the end of time, since the Gospel they handed on is
the lasting source of all life for the Church. Therefore, . . . the apostles
took care to appoint successors.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15G href=#$15G>373</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bishops
- successors of the apostles</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>861
&quot;In order that the mission entrusted to them might be continued after
their death, [the apostles] consigned, by will and testament, as it were, to
their immediate collaborators the duty of completing and consolidating the work
they had begun, urging them to tend to the whole flock, in which the Holy
Spirit had appointed them to shepherd the Church of God. They accordingly
designated such men and then made the ruling that likewise on their death other
proven men should take over their ministry.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15H href=#$15H>374</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>862
&quot;Just as the office which the Lord confided to Peter alone, as first of
the apostles, destined to be transmitted to his successors, is a permanent one,
so also endures the office, which the apostles received, of shepherding the
Church, a charge destined to be exercised without interruption by the sacred
order of bishops.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15I href=#$15I>375</a></sup></font> Hence the Church teaches that &quot;the
bishops have by divine institution taken the place of the apostles as pastors
of the Church, in such wise that whoever listens to them is listening to Christ
and whoever despises them despises Christ and him who sent
Christ.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15J href=#$15J>376</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
apostolate</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>863
The whole Church is apostolic, in that she remains, through the successors of
St. Peter and the other apostles, in communion of faith and life with her
origin: and in that she is &quot;sent out&quot; into the whole world. All
members of the Church share in this mission, though in various ways. &quot;The
Christian vocation is, of its nature, a vocation to the apostolate as
well.&quot; Indeed, we call an apostolate &quot;every activity of the Mystical
Body&quot; that aims &quot;to spread the Kingdom of Christ over all the earth.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15K href=#$15K>377</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>864
&quot;Christ, sent by the Father, is the source of the Church's whole
apostolate&quot;; thus the fruitfulness of apostolate for ordained ministers as
well as for lay people clearly depends on their vital union with
Christ.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15L href=#$15L>378</a></sup></font> In keeping with their vocations, the demands of the times
and the various gifts of the Holy Spirit, the apostolate assumes the most
varied forms. But charity, drawn from the Eucharist above all, is always
&quot;as it were, the soul of the whole apostolate.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15M href=#$15M>379</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>865
The Church is ultimately one, holy, catholic, and apostolic in her deepest and
ultimate identity, because it is in her that &quot;the Kingdom of heaven,&quot;
the &quot;Reign of God,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15N href=#$15N>380</a></sup></font> already exists and will be fulfilled
at the end of time. the kingdom has come in the person of Christ and grows
mysteriously in the hearts of those incorporated into him, until its full
eschatological manifestation. Then all those he has redeemed and made
&quot;holy and blameless before him in love,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15O href=#$15O>381</a></sup></font> will be gathered
together as the one People of God, the <br>
&quot;Bride of the Lamb,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15P href=#$15P>382</a></sup></font> &quot;the holy city Jerusalem coming
down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15Q href=#$15Q>383</a></sup></font> For
&quot;the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names
of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-15R href=#$15R>384</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>866 The Church is one: she
acknowledges one Lord, confesses one faith, is born of one Baptism, forms only
one Body, is given life by the one Spirit, for the sake of one hope (cf <A target=_blank href=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P10B.HTM#NTLET.EPH.4.3><b>&#8658;</b></A> Eph
4:3-5), at whose fulfillment all divisions will be overcome.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>867 The Church is holy: the
Most Holy God is her author; Christ, her bridegroom, gave himself up to make
her holy; the Spirit of holiness gives her life. Since she still includes
sinners, she is &quot;the sinless one made up of sinners.&quot; Her holiness
shines in the saints; in Mary she is already all-holy.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>868 The Church is catholic:
she proclaims the fullness of the faith. She bears in herself and administers
the totality of the means of salvation. She is sent out to all peoples. She
speaks to all men. She encompasses all times. She is &quot;missionary of her
very nature&quot; (AG 2).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>869 The Church is apostolic.
She is built on a lasting foundation: &quot;the twelve apostles of the

 <A target=_blank href=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVP.HTM#GOSP.MAT.16.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mt 16:18). She is upheld infallibly in the
