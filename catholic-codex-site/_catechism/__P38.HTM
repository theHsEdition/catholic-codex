<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>II. How is the Liturgy Celebrated?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Signs and
symbols</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1145
A sacramental celebration is woven from signs and symbols. In keeping with the
divine pedagogy of salvation, their meaning is rooted in the work of creation
and in human culture, specified by the events of the Old Covenant and fully
revealed in the person and work of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1146
Signs of the human world. In human life, signs and symbols occupy an important
place. As a being at once body and spirit, man expresses and perceives
spiritual realities through physical signs and symbols. As a social being, man
needs signs and symbols to communicate with others, through language, gestures,
and actions. the same holds true for his relationship with God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1147
God speaks to man through the visible creation. the material cosmos is so
presented to man's intelligence that he can read there traces of its
Creator.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FL href=#$1FL>16</a></sup></font> Light and darkness, wind and fire, water and earth, the tree
and its fruit speak of God and symbolize both his greatness and his nearness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1148
Inasmuch as they are creatures, these perceptible realities can become means of
expressing the action of God who sanctifies men, and the action of men who
offer worship to God. the same is true of signs and symbols taken from the
social life of man: washing and anointing, breaking bread and sharing the cup
can express the sanctifying presence of God and man's gratitude toward his
Creator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1149
The great religions of mankind witness, often impressively, to this cosmic and
symbolic meaning of religious rites. the liturgy of the Church presupposes,
integrates and sanctifies elements from creation and human culture, conferring
on them the dignity of signs of grace, of the new creation in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1150
Signs of the covenant. the Chosen People received from God distinctive signs
and symbols that marked its liturgical life. These are no longer solely
celebrations of cosmic cycles and social gestures, but signs of the covenant,
symbols of God's mighty deeds for his people. Among these liturgical signs from
the Old Covenant are circumcision, anointing and consecration of kings and
priests, laying on of hands, sacrifices, and above all the Passover. the Church
sees in these signs a prefiguring of the sacraments of the New Covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1151
Signs taken up by Christ. In his preaching the Lord Jesus often makes use of
the signs of creation to make known the mysteries of the Kingdom of
God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FM href=#$1FM>17</a></sup></font> He performs healings and illustrates his preaching with physical
signs or symbolic gestures.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FN href=#$1FN>18</a></sup></font> He gives new meaning to the deeds and
signs of the Old Covenant, above all to the Exodus and the Passover,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FO href=#$1FO>19</a></sup></font>
for he himself is the meaning of all these signs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1152
Sacramental signs. Since Pentecost, it is through the sacramental signs of his
Church that the Holy Spirit carries on the work of sanctification. the
sacraments of the Church do not abolish but purify and integrate all the
richness of the signs and symbols of the cosmos and of social life. Further,
they fulfill the types and figures of the Old Covenant, signify and make
actively present the salvation wrought by Christ, and prefigure and anticipate
the glory of heaven. Words and actions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1153
A sacramental celebration is a meeting of God's children with their Father, in
Christ and the Holy Spirit; this meeting takes the form of a dialogue, through
actions and words. Admittedly, the symbolic actions are already a language, but
the Word of God and the response of faith have to accompany and give life to
them, so that the seed of the Kingdom can bear its fruit in good soil. the
liturgical actions signify what the Word of God expresses: both his free
initiative and his people's response of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1154
The liturgy of the Word is an integral part of sacramental celebrations. To
nourish the faith of believers, the signs which accompany the Word of God
should be emphasized: the book of the Word (a lectionary or a book of the
Gospels), its veneration (procession, incense, candles), the place of its
proclamation (lectern or ambo), its audible and intelligible reading, the
minister's homily which extends its proclamation, and the responses of the
assembly (acclamations, meditation psalms, litanies, and profession of faith).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1155
The liturgical word and action are inseparable both insofar as they are signs
and instruction and insofar as they accomplish what they signify. When the Holy
Spirit awakens faith, he not only gives an understanding of the Word of God,
but through the sacraments also makes present the &quot;wonders&quot; of God
which it proclaims. the Spirit makes present and communicates the Father's
work, fulfilled by the beloved Son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Singing and
music</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1156
&quot;The musical tradition of the universal Church is a treasure of
inestimable value, greater even than that of any other art. the main reason for
this pre-eminence is that, as a combination of sacred music and words, it forms
a necessary or integral part of solemn liturgy.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FP href=#$1FP>20</a></sup></font> The composition
and singing of inspired psalms, often accompanied by musical instruments, were already
closely linked to the liturgical celebrations of the Old Covenant. the Church
continues and develops this tradition: &quot;Address . . . one another in
psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord
with all your heart.&quot; &quot;He who sings prays twice.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FQ href=#$1FQ>21</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1157
Song and music fulfill their function as signs in a manner all the more
significant when they are &quot;more closely connected . . . with the
liturgical action,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FR href=#$1FR>22</a></sup></font> according to three principal criteria:
beauty expressive of prayer, the unanimous participation of the assembly at the
designated moments, and the solemn character of the celebration. In this way
they participate in the purpose of the liturgical words and actions: the glory
of God and the sanctification of the faithful:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FS href=#$1FS>23</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>How I wept, deeply moved by
your hymns, songs, and the voices that echoed through your Church! What emotion
I experienced in them! Those sounds flowed into my ears distilling the truth in
my heart. A feeling of devotion surged within me, and tears streamed down my
face - tears that did me good.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FT href=#$1FT>24</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1158
The harmony of signs (song, music, words, and actions) is all the more expressive
and fruitful when expressed in the cultural richness of the People of God who
celebrate.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FU href=#$1FU>25</a></sup></font> Hence &quot;religious singing by the faithful is to be
intelligently fostered so that in devotions and sacred exercises as well as in
liturgical services,&quot; in conformity with the Church's norms, &quot;the
voices of the faithful may be heard.&quot; But &quot;the texts intended to be
sung must always be in conformity with Catholic doctrine. Indeed they should be
drawn chiefly from the Sacred Scripture and from liturgical
sources.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FV href=#$1FV>26</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Holy images</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1159
The sacred image, the liturgical icon, principally represents Christ. It cannot
represent the invisible and incomprehensible God, but the incarnation of the
Son of God has ushered in a new &quot;economy&quot; of images:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Previously God, who has
neither a body nor a face, absolutely could not be represented by an image. But
now that he has made himself visible in the flesh and has lived with men, I can
make an image of what I have seen of God . . . and contemplate the glory of the
Lord, his face unveiled.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FW href=#$1FW>27</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1160
Christian iconography expresses in images the same Gospel message that
Scripture communicates by words. Image and word illuminate each other:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>We declare that we preserve
intact all the written and unwritten traditions of the Church which have been
entrusted to us. One of these traditions consists in the production of
representational artwork, which accords with the history of the preaching of
the Gospel. For it confirms that the incarnation of the Word of God was real
and not imaginary, and to our benefit as well, for realities that illustrate
each other undoubtedly reflect each other's meaning.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FX href=#$1FX>28</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1161
All the signs in the liturgical celebrations are related to Christ: as are
sacred images of the holy Mother of God and of the saints as well. They truly
signify Christ, who is glorified in them. They make manifest the &quot;cloud of
witnesses&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FY href=#$1FY>29</a></sup></font> who continue to participate in the salvation of the
world and to whom we are united, above all in sacramental celebrations. Through
their icons, it is man &quot;in the image of God,&quot; finally transfigured
&quot;into his likeness,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1FZ href=#$1FZ>30</a></sup></font> who is revealed to our faith. So too
are the angels, who also are recapitulated in Christ:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Following the divinely
inspired teaching of our holy Fathers and the tradition of the Catholic Church
(for we know that this tradition comes from the Holy Spirit who dwells in her)
we rightly define with full certainty and correctness that, like the figure of
the precious and life-giving cross, venerable and holy images of our Lord and
God and Savior, Jesus Christ, our inviolate Lady, the holy Mother of God, and
the venerated angels, all the saints and the just, whether painted or made of
mosaic or another suitable material, are to be exhibited in the holy churches
of God, on sacred vessels and vestments, walls and panels, in houses and on
streets.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1G0 href=#$1G0>31</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1162
&quot;The beauty of the images moves me to contemplation, as a meadow delights
the eyes and subtly infuses the soul with the glory of God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1G1 href=#$1G1>32</a></sup></font>
Similarly, the contemplation of sacred icons, united with meditation on the
Word of God and the singing of liturgical hymns, enters into the harmony of the
signs of celebration so that the mystery celebrated is imprinted in the heart's
memory and is then expressed in the new life of the faithful.</p>
