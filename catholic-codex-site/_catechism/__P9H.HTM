<p class=MsoNormal>A cloud of
witnesses</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2683
The witnesses who have preceded us into the kingdom,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OY href=#$2OY>41</a></sup></font> especially those
whom the Church recognizes as saints, share in the living tradition of prayer
by the example of their lives, the transmission of their writings, and their
prayer today. They contemplate God, praise him and constantly care for those
whom they have left on earth. When they entered into the joy of their Master,
they were &quot;put in charge of many things.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OZ href=#$2OZ>42</a></sup></font> Their intercession
is their most exalted service to God's plan. We can and should ask them to
intercede for us and for the whole world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2684
In the communion of saints, many and varied spiritualities have been developed
throughout the history of the churches. the personal charism of some witnesses
to God's love for men has been handed on, like &quot;the spirit&quot; of Elijah
to Elisha and John the Baptist, so that their followers may have a share in
this spirit.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2P0 href=#$2P0>43</a></sup></font> A distinct spirituality can also arise at the point of
convergence of liturgical and theological currents, bearing witness to the
integration of the faith into a particular human environment and its history.
the different schools of Christian spirituality share in the living tradition of
prayer and are essential guides for the faithful. In their rich diversity they
are refractions of the one pure light of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The Spirit is truly the
dwelling of the saints and the saints are for the Spirit a place where he
dwells as in his own home since they offer themselves as a dwelling place for
God and are called his temple.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2P1 href=#$2P1>44</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Servants of
prayer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2685
The Christian family is the first place of education in prayer. Based on the
sacrament of marriage, the family is the &quot;domestic church&quot; where
God's children learn to pray &quot;as the Church&quot; and to persevere in
prayer. For young children in particular, daily family prayer is the first
witness of the Church's living memory as awakened patiently by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2686
Ordained ministers are also responsible for the formation in prayer of their
brothers and sisters in Christ. Servants of the Good Shepherd, they are
ordained to lead the People of God to the living waters of prayer: the Word of
God, the liturgy, the theological life (the life of faith, hope, and charity),
and the Today of God in concrete situations.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2P2 href=#$2P2>45</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2687
Many religious have consecrated their whole lives to prayer. Hermits, monks,
and nuns since the time of the desert fathers have devoted their time to
praising God and interceding for his people. the consecrated life cannot be
sustained or spread without prayer; it is one of the living sources of
contemplation and the spiritual life of the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2688
The catechesis of children, young people, and adults aims at teaching them to
meditate on the Word of God in personal prayer, practicing it in liturgical
prayer, and internalizing it at all times in order to bear fruit in a new life.
Catechesis is also a time for the discernment and education of popular
piety.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2P3 href=#$2P3>46</a></sup></font> The memorization of basic prayers offers an essential support
to the life of prayer, but it is important to help learners savor their
meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2689
Prayer groups, indeed &quot;schools of prayer,&quot; are today one of the signs
and one of the driving forces of renewal of prayer in the Church, provided they
drink from authentic wellsprings of Christian prayer. Concern for ecclesial
communion is a sign of true prayer in the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2690
The Holy Spirit gives to certain of the faithful the gifts of wisdom, faith and
discernment for the sake of this common good which is prayer (spiritual
direction). Men and women so endowed are true servants of the living tradition
of prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>According to St. John of the
Cross, the person wishing to advance toward perfection should &quot;take care
into whose hands he entrusts himself, for as the master is, so will the
disciple be, and as the father is so will be the son.&quot; and further: &quot;In
addition to being learned and discreet a director should be experienced.... If
the spiritual director has no experience of the spiritual life, he will be
incapable of leading into it the souls whom God is calling to it, and he will
not even understand them.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2P4 href=#$2P4>47</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Places
favorable for prayer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2691
The church, the house of God, is the proper place for the liturgical prayer of
the parish community. It is also the privileged place for adoration of the real
presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament. the choice of a favorable place is
not a matter of indifference for true prayer. <br>
- For personal prayer, this can be a &quot;prayer corner&quot; with the Sacred
Scriptures and icons, in order to be there, in secret, before our
Father.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2P5 href=#$2P5>48</a></sup></font> In a Christian family, this kind of little oratory fosters
prayer in common. <br>
- In regions where monasteries exist, the vocation of these communities is to
further the participation of the faithful in the Liturgy of the Hours and to
provide necessary solitude for more intense personal prayer.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2P6 href=#$2P6>49</a></sup></font> <br>
- Pilgrimages evoke our earthly journey toward heaven and are traditionally
very special occasions for renewal in prayer. For pilgrims seeking living
water, shrines are special places for living the forms of Christian prayer
&quot;in Church.&quot;</p>
