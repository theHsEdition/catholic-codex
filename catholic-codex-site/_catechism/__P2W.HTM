<p class=MsoNormal>Christ
glorified . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1084
&quot;Seated at the right hand of the Father&quot; and pouring out the Holy
Spirit on his Body which is the Church, Christ now acts through the sacraments
he instituted to communicate his grace. the sacraments are perceptible signs
(words and actions) accessible to our human nature. By the action of Christ and
the power of the Holy Spirit they make present efficaciously the grace that
they signify.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1085
In the liturgy of the Church, it is principally his own Paschal mystery that
Christ signifies and makes present. During his earthly life Jesus announced his
Paschal mystery by his teaching and anticipated it by his actions. When his
Hour comes, he lives out the unique event of history which does not pass away:
Jesus dies, is buried, rises from the dead, and is seated at the right hand of
the Father &quot;once for all.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1DR href=#$1DR>8</a></sup></font> His Paschal mystery is a real
event that occurred in our history, but it is unique: all other historical
events happen once, and then they pass away, swallowed up in the past. the
Paschal mystery of Christ, by contrast, cannot remain only in the past, because
by his death he destroyed death, and all that Christ is - all that he did and
suffered for all men - participates in the divine eternity, and so transcends
all times while being made present in them all. the event of the Cross and
Resurrection abides and draws everything toward life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>. . . from
the time of the Church of the Apostles . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1086
&quot;Accordingly, just as Christ was sent by the Father so also he sent the
apostles, filled with the Holy Spirit. This he did so that they might preach
the Gospel to every creature and proclaim that the Son of God by his death and
resurrection had freed us from the power of Satan and from death and brought us
into the Kingdom of his Father. But he also willed that the work of salvation
which they preached should be set in train through the sacrifice and sacraments,
around which the entire liturgical life revolves.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1DS href=#$1DS>9</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1087
Thus the risen Christ, by giving the Holy Spirit to the apostles, entrusted to
them his power of sanctifying:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1DT href=#$1DT>10</a></sup></font> they became sacramental signs of Christ.
By the power of the same Holy Spirit they entrusted this power to their
successors. This</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;apostolic
succession&quot; structures the whole liturgical life of the Church and is
itself sacramental, handed on by the sacrament of Holy Orders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>. . . is
present in the earthly liturgy . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1088
&quot;To accomplish so great a work&quot; - the dispensation or communication
of his work of salvation - &quot;Christ is always present in his Church,
especially in her liturgical celebrations. He is present in the Sacrifice of
the Mass not only in the person of his minister, 'the same now offering,
through the ministry of priests, who formerly offered himself on the cross,'
but especially in the Eucharistic species. By his power he is present in the
sacraments so that when anybody baptizes, it is really Christ himself who
baptizes. He is present in his word since it is he himself who speaks when the
holy Scriptures are read in the Church. Lastly, he is present when the Church
prays and sings, for he has promised 'where two or three are gathered together
in my name there am I in the midst of them.&quot;'<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1DU href=#$1DU>11</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1089
&quot;Christ, indeed, always associates the Church with himself in this great
work in which God is perfectly glorified and men are sanctified. the Church is
his beloved Bride who calls to her Lord and through him offers worship to the
eternal Father.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1DV href=#$1DV>12</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>. . . which
participates in the liturgy of heaven</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1090
&quot;In the earthly liturgy we share in a foretaste of that heavenly liturgy
which is celebrated in the Holy City of Jerusalem toward which we journey as
pilgrims, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, Minister of the
sanctuary and of the true tabernacle. With all the warriors of the heavenly
army we sing a hymn of glory to the Lord; venerating the memory of the saints,
we hope for some part and fellowship with them; we eagerly await the Savior,
our Lord Jesus Christ, until he, our life, shall appear and we too will appear
with him in glory.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1DW href=#$1DW>13</a></sup></font></p>
