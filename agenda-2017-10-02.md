## 2017-10-02 Meeting Notes

`Keep in mind this is rough notes, so it's not super accurate of who said what.`

At topic for discussion: 
What is the problem we are trying to solve or the need we are trying to address?

John 
- Direct to millennial, to help people defend the faith and understand it better. give them the tools to articulate it in their minds.
- More of an authority than a forum, it should not be ambiguous.
- Why does the Church believe what it believes?
- People could understand and truly articulate things than just react on an emotional level.

Ryan had the thought:
- Steering thought
- Structured way of approaching it, not just random solutions, but people who want to formulate.
- Exploration vs. Defending?
- 

Daniel
- his big problem has been things developing in the workplace, being asked questions by protestants, and it’s been difficult to find materials that are going the full correct answer, falling into more of apologetics as opposed to just faith. So you can describe the reason and the logic behind the concepts.
- He thinks we should provide based in logic and reason for Catholics as well as non-catholics.

Patrick:
- I think real world situation are important
- I think being brief is important
- How much reason/faith

What is the idea of the truth?
It’s where faith and reason meets.

Who is our audience?
- Young people
- DRY Theology

We should have a foundation for truth.

John wants to give straight answers, like a YES or a NO without getting into the nitty gritty.

Ryan brought up the concept of using Suma theological structure for answering questions, so that everything can be boiled down to the same foundation. But using a TL;DR type structure.

### The problem bit
### Authority bit
### Common Sense / Reason bit

How are we gathering content?
the site can have a blog
the site can have an explanation for sacraments.

Questions to answer
Why do I believe in the bible at all?
Why is sex reserved for matrimony?

What is our MVP?
- is it a blog?
- is it the sacraments?
- is it the structure?
- Addressing our target audience?

John says to start with a Blog and start posting one a week to get our creative ideas going.

Sacraments, giving an explanation of what they are and what they do for people.

Ryan says to think of a high-level structure first. and then flush out the topics.

This needs to be scalable.

Start with a shared Google Sheets document? Have a text file we can fill in the blanks and wait for issues in the content and the ideas. We can then mess around with structures and figure out what will bend or break.

Ryan suggested Brightspot content management system, very customizable and flexible. Very searchy. Used very heavily in complex websites, you can used php to show the content. They have some out of the box templates.

we can host it on AWS Medium instance which costs about $1/day. (we might be able get it set up on eHost)

grace is going to think about during the day. and work on the parent side of things and the marriage side of things. She can cover medical issues and brain death, organ donation and things like that.

> Baptism ( I say we all work on it together )
1. Is baptism necessary for salvation
2. Does baptism change the soul?

Create a google doc and we all work on it. git hub we can do pull request. (Patrick will do this)

Make a google drive account with all the information there. 

Daniel
- Set up the google account
- Send people the UN and PW for this.

Ryan
- Set up the next conference call

Patrick
- Investigate bright spot
